"Vladimir Guerrero Jr.","TOR","3B","MLB",1,1,,"70",2019,"Med","21.2361111","6' 1""","240","R","R","2015 J2 (TOR)","Dominican Republic","The best prospect in baseball, Guerrero hit a superhuman .381/.437/.636 across 95 games (mostly at Double and Triple-A) despite being about six years younger than the other athletes in the Eastern and International Leagues. The ball doesn't just sound different off of his bat; when he really lays into one, you can feel a thump inside your chest as if someone set off a firework at home plate. It’s explosive, beautiful, and paradoxically violent considering that Vladimir is so childlike in his shape and demeanor. He plays with a vivacious enthusiasm, totally unashamed of his own at times bizarre mannerisms, as if the way he feels when playing elite pro baseball is how most of us did with a wiffle ball in our hands during adolescence. (Late during Fall League, he was cranky and petulant with umpires.) 
But his is not a childlike stature. His listed 6-foot-1, 200 pounds is a farce, and on the few occasions that Guerrero and Peter Alonso (who is listed at 6-foot-3, 245) were standing near one another during Fall League, Vlad was clearly the larger human being. While he reaches an almost shocking top speed on the bases given his size, Guerrero does have lateral mobility issues that impact his range at third base. He is very likely to move to first base or DH at some point in his early 20s, but leaving him at third, even if he's not very good there, might help motivate him to keep his weight in check for as long as possible, something that could be more important than the quality of his play in the field since Vlad had knee issues during the 2018 season. 
Really though, it matters very little where he ends up playing. This is the best hitter in the minors and the stick will play anywhere. For at least two years now people around baseball, including the late Mel Didier, swore that Guerrero would be ready for and competing in the majors before he turned 20. Toronto's desire to maintain control of his talent for as long as possible scuttled that notion late last summer when they chose not to promote him, and Vlad will turn 20 in March before this season even starts. He should be up early this year, and immediately become one of the game's most exciting, productive hitters. He is the cornerstone of the Blue Jays franchise, and perhaps a cornerstone of our sport.","0pq1nJRuxC4","19611"
"Wander Franco","TBR","SS","A+",2,1,,"65",2021,"High","19.2777777","5' 10""","190","S","R","2017 J2 (TBR)","Dominican Republic","Franco was identified as a top tier player in his age group as early as 12 or 13, and was seen regularly by scouts by age 14. Sometimes, precocious prospects are workout warriors or have early physical peaks, but Franco isn't either of those. He essentially hasn't failed on a baseball field in any meaningful way since puberty, with his success punctuated by a 2018 pro debut in which he outpaced the game's most recent phenom, No. 1 overall prospect Vladimir Guerrero, Jr., in just about every way, at the same level, at the same age. Franco signed for the largest bonus in the 2017 July 2nd class ($3.825 million) and was seen as the best player in the class by a good margin. There were some questions about his occasionally disinterested style of play as an amateur, but he likely already had a deal done and didn't have anything to play for in later workouts. He's literally always been the best player on any field he's been on, usually by a lot. The raw tools are accordingly loud, and match his stats: at least a plus hit tool with explosive bat speed, elite bat and body control, and an advanced sense of the zone to go along with plus raw power, plus speed, a plus arm, and a real chance to stick at shortstop. Franco is about as close as you'll see to a perfect prospect at this point, with questions only arising if you really nitpick -- the main one being that Franco isn't tall -- but he already has huge power, so it matters less that he isn't physically projectable. The Rays have indicated they will start Franco at Low-A in 2019 and, so long as he keeps performing, keep pushing him until he's challenged so he can experience adversity before he reaches the big leagues. It wouldn't surprise us to see Franco move across multiple levels, but we wouldn't expect a Juan Soto-esque pace of promotion, and a 2019 MLB debut seems incredibly unlikely, given the Rays' upper-level infield glut and the service time implications. Rays officials have likened their immediate impression of Franco, as a player and person, to Evan Longoria. Teammates respond to him, and there isn't even a whiff of the makeup concern some scouts conjured up as an amateur. Franco seems to be the sole author of his potential at this point.","OsxMtDgMaI0","sa3007033"
"Fernando Tatis Jr.","SDP","SS","MLB",3,1,,"65",2019,"High","21.4416666","6' 3""","185","R","R","2015 J2 (CHW)","Dominican Republic","Though his numbers were mostly the same as they were during a very impressive 2018 at Double-A San Antonio (.286/.355/.507, 16 HR, 16 SB), Tatis appeared to come of age during the offseason in the higher-stakes environment of the Dominican Winter League. Except for the sliver of our population who are both prospect hounds and savvy internet streamers, Tatis' LIDOM brilliance was mostly obscured from American eyes, and may one day exist only as an oral history, the way John Lucas and Bernard King's D.C. summer league cameos do for basketball fans today. 
Nevertheless, MLB scouts and teams are well-aware of Tatis' all-world physical gifts, but the Padres knew first. Scouted and snatched away from the Camelback Ranch backfields by A.J. Preller himself, Tatis had barely worn a White Sox uniform before he was flipped to San Diego for James Shields during 2016 Extended Spring. He wasn't a highly-regarded amateur prospect when he signed the year before the trade, but he got better very quickly and essentially hasn't stopped. He has Carlos Correa's frame, but is more agile and acrobatic a defender than Correa, and while there's some risk that Tatis will eventually fill out beyond viability at shortstop, it probably won't be for a while, and in the interim he's going to be quite good there. He also has power that is rare for the big leagues generally, let alone for a middle infielder, and he has gotten to it in games thus far despite some issues with strikeouts. There's a sizable gap between the low-end of Tatis' possible outcomes (he moves to third quickly and always has contact issues) and the high end (he becomes a plus glove at short and has an offensive trajectory like George Springer's, whose contact issues suddenly went away) but right tail outcomes like this barely exist across baseball. 
Strikeout-prone prospects often require some time to adjust and can take a little bit to perform, but we like Tatis' chances to become a superstar, the crest of the Padres' wave of young talent and a cornerstone of a burgeoning franchise.","f-7iDniIWf0","19709"
"Forrest Whitley","HOU","RHP","AA",4,1,,"65",2019,"High","22.7388888","6' 7""","225","R","R","2016 Draft Rnd 1 (HOU)","Alamo Heights HS (TX)","Whitley was listed at 235 pounds on the 2015 Area Code Games roster but was tipping the scales at 260 not long before that. At that event, he was sitting in the 90-92 range with feel for locating a solid-average curveball. He looked like a mature-bodied pitchability prospect whose stuff might be done improving. During that fall and winter, though, Whitley began to reshape his physique. He dropped about 50 pounds and came out the following spring with much better stuff, his fastball creeping into the 93-95 range and touching 97. 
Whitley and his stuff have continued to improve, though he had a somewhat chaotic 2018. He missed the season's first 50 games due to a suspension for the use of an unknown stimulant, then had his season debut pushed back due to a lat strain. He finally toed the rubber at Double-A Corpus Christi in June and made five four-inning starts before he was removed in the first inning of his sixth outing and placed on the IL with an oblique strain. He missed a little over a month, then made two more starts in August before feeling lat discomfort warming up for what would have been a third. He was shut down as a precaution and sent to the Arizona Fall League to pick up innings. 
His stuff was wholly intact in Arizona, as Whitley sat 93-97 and touched 99. His apparitional changeup haunts both left and right-handed hitters, disappearing beneath barrels as it approaches the plate. Whitley's array of breaking stuff is well-designed. His power 12-6 curveball honors his Texas heritage but has been de-emphasized as an out pitch in deference to his tilting, mid-80s slider. He has the best collection of stuff in the minor leagues, and might have been in the big leagues last year if not for various setbacks. He may be on somewhat of an innings limit this year because he didn't pitch all that much in 2018, but barring that, we expect he'll help the Astros cause at some point in 2019.

"Victor Robles","WSN","CF","MLB",5,1,,"65",2019,"Low","23.0611111","6' 0""","185","R","R","2013 J2 (WSN)","Dominican Republic","If not for a hyperextended elbow that shelved him for several months in 2018, Robles wouldn't be on this list. (The injury to Robles was also part of why Washington pushed Juan Soto along quickly.) In the 2017 Fall League (he missed some time that season due to hamstring tightness), he looked both readier and nearly as talented as fellow Fall Leaguer Ronald Acuña, and it seemed certain that he'd be up for good at some point the following spring. But in April an awkward dive on a shallow fly ball that most center fielders wouldn't even have sniffed at bent Robles' elbow backward and based on the way he writhed around in pain, the injury appeared catastrophic. X-rays were negative and an MRI showed no structural damage, but Robles didn't start swinging a bat for a month and a half and was out of game action for three. He spent July and August rehabbing before a great September in Washington, during which he slashed .288/.348/.525. This is a do-everything center fielder who glides from gap to gap, has runner-halting arm strength, and plus-plus speed that is aided by seemingly sixth-sense instincts on the bases. Robles has middling bat speed and doesn't generate huge exit velocity, but he has above-average hand-eye coordination, bat control, and pitch recognition, and a gap-to-gap approach that suits his speed. He'll slug on paper by turning the line drives he slaps into the gaps in to extra bases. Robles has slightly below-average plate discipline, which may dilute his production for a bit, but he projects as a 3-plus WAR center fielder with a skillset akin to Lorenzo Cain's, and he's big league ready right now.","3VwXSd7XgXo","18363"

Toward the end of showcase season, scouts started throwing around Derek Jeter comparisons, saying that Lewis had a similar frame with chance for a 70 bat, 55 raw power, and the possibility to stick at shortstop with some work. Others saw closer to a 50 or 55 bat and a center fielder, and his draft spring was up-and-down, with scouts that charted all of his games reporting his hitting stats were not strong, though the tools were all still present. 
The Twins took him first overall and cut a below slot deal, as Lewis was seen as one of five options in a top tier of talent without a clear top prospect. Things have gone even better than expected for Lewis in pro ball, and he's hit above league average at every stop and reached High-A at age 19 while improving defensively at shortstop. Most scouts think he can stick there, which was not the case even a year ago, and one long-time scout even said Lewis is ahead of where Jeter was defensively at the same stage. We'll call it a 60 bat with 50 game power and 50 defense, but there's ceiling for more in here.","IRGoLxDpn0U","sa3004259"
"Nick Senzel","CIN","3B","MLB",7,1,,"60",2019,"Med","24.95","6' 1""","205","R","R","2016 Draft Rnd 1 (CIN)","Tennessee","Several freak injuries upended Senzel's 2018. He missed most of May battling vertigo symptoms for the second time in nine months (they first started in late August '17), then fractured a finger in late-June and missed the rest of the season. He was supposed to play in the Fall League, but a return of the left elbow pain he had played through during the year became severe enough that he needed an MRI, which revealed bone spurs. He had surgery and was shut down for the year. When Senzel did play, he was very good and slashed .310/.378/.509 in 44 games at Triple-A while playing second base for the first time in affiliated ball. Senzel's likely future defensive home is still to be determined. He wasn't a very good defensive third baseman early in college but became one as a junior. The presence of Eugenio Suarez led to reps at second base, and Scooter Gennett's emergence led to what was supposed to be reps in left and center field this fall before Senzel needed surgery. The departure of Billy Hamilton leaves an obvious hole that he could potentially fill, but he hasn't been seen playing center enough to know for sure. At the very least, he has stumbled into defensive versatility. Mostly though, Senzel hits. He doesn’t have monster raw power, nor does he seek to take max-effort swings by utilizing a big stride or leg kick. Instead, his power comes from precise, high-quality contact. He’s going to be a doubles machine with home runs coming opportunistically rather than playing core aspect of his approach, but he’ll still hit for power. He has the skills and polish of a near-ready star, and the injuries don't seem like they're going to be a chronic thing. ","1Jkza_J-9MU","19293"
"Eloy Jimenez","CHW","RF","MLB",8,1,,"60",2019,"High","23.5388888","6' 4""","225","R","R","2013 J2 (CHC)","Dominican Republic","Even before the White Sox acquired Jimenez from the Cubs in the Jose Quintana trade, he had dealt with a multitude of injuries. Hamstring and shoulder issues plagued him while he was still with the Cubs, and limited him to DH duty, or forced him to sit out for a few days at a time, or altogether kept rehabbing him on the Mesa backfields. He has continued to have various issues since the South Siders acquired him. In 2018 alone, Jimenez dealt with patella tendinitis during the early part of spring training, then was left back in extended due to a strained pec. He suffered a strained left adductor in July, and finally a quad strain this winter, which ended his Dominican Winter League season. 
But while Eloy has missed considerable time with injuries and sometimes played through them, he has mashed like few other players in the minors. He split 2018 between Double-A Birmingham and Triple-A Charlotte, slashing .337/.384/.577, his strikeout rate plummeting to 13% at the latter stop. Despite his limited speed and at-bats, he somehow managed to net 53 extra-base hits and seemed ready for a big league cup of coffee in September. The White Sox refused to brew him one, and Eloy's agent threatened to file a grievance against the club, an issue that was resolved during 2019 spring training with a record contract extension. He'll likely be up all year, and while we think there's a chance injury or a lack of mobility limit Eloy's ceiling the way flaws have similarly limited some of Chicago's other recent prospect graduates, we still think he'll hit enough to be a star.","rGa1I4XSrsE","17484"
"Bo Bichette","TOR","SS","MLB",9,2,,"60",2020,"High","22.2666666","6' 0""","200","R","R","2016 Draft Rnd 2 (TOR)","Lakewood HS (FL)","There's some contextual disappointment surrounding Bichette's 2018 statline because he didn't recreate his video game numbers from the year before, but he still netted an incredible 61 extra-base hits as a 20-year-old at Double-A. We remain skeptical of his long term viability at shortstop, where he continues to see most of his reps, but his arm is plus and teams are growing increasingly willing to put players with limited lateral quickness at short if it means shoehorning a special offensive talent into the position, and Bichette is one. 
Ultimately, it probably doesn't matter where he ends up playing defense because his bat is likely to profile. He has scintillating bat speed, and Bichette's hand-eye coordination and bat control are an effective foil for the garage band noisiness of his swing, which hasn't negatively impacted his ability to make contact in pro ball. Bichette ditches his leg kick with two strikes, something we're not certain is all that helpful based on visual evidence. Ideally, Bichette will start lifting the ball more often (he has a league-average ground ball rate right now) and turn some of these doubles into homers, but it's hard to justify making a change when he has been wildly successful so far. Status quo Bo is still a doubles machine who probably stays on the infield, and is a likely All-Star.","lRUNUyhGHkM","19612"
"Kyle Tucker","HOU","RF","MLB",10,2,,"60",2019,"Med","23.4","6' 4""","200","L","R","2015 Draft Rnd 1 (HOU)","Plant HS (FL)","A very divisive amateur prospect, some scouts were put off by Tucker's unique swing, while it reminded others of Ted Williams'. The Astros have parlayed his natural bat control into more power. Tucker has gotten stronger and more physically mature, his lower half is better incorporated into his swing than it was in high school, and in 2017, he began lifting the ball more as his ground ball rate dropped from 42% to 34%. With that additional lift has come in-game power and Tucker has slugged well over .500 during each of the last two seasons, and hit about 25 homers during each campaign. He had a horrendous 28-game big league debut but his long track record of hitting suggests that should be heavily discounted. 
Though Tucker spent much of his minor league career in center field, he's a below average runner who is ticketed for an outfield corner, probably in right. He's an opportunistic base stealer but almost all of his value is tied to his bat, and we think he eventually ends up as a middle of the order bat with a dynamic hit/power combination. 
There are still detractors who don't like Tucker's motor, or his swing, but on the low end he projects somewhere in the Max Kepler/Nomar Mazara area, and that still plays everyday.","z84M9j2JoEc","18345"

The swing and miss issues he exhibited in high school led many to assume his development might be slow, but after a month of vaporizing Low-A pitching at Burlington, he was quickly sent to the Cal League, where he'd spend most of the year. At Inland Empire, Adell continued to perform, and the Angels pushed him to Double-A Mobile in August, where he was finally forced to deal with some adversity, and struck out 31% of the time. 
Several prospects of recent memory (Byron Buxton, Domonic Brown, and Brandon Wood to name a few) have possessed such titanic physical gifts that they essentially weren't challenged until they reached the big leagues, and some people in baseball posit that it can be psychologically taxing to deal with growing pains in that bright of a spotlight, with the hopes of a franchise and its fans on one's shoulders. Adell is that kind of physical talent. He has a rare blend of power and speed, speed that he has retained since high school even though he has added about 20 pounds. He's now a better bet to stay in center field during his prime than he was in high school, when scouts assumed he'd slow down as he added weight. His feel for going back on balls in center is pretty good and some of the arm strength that Adell (who was once into the mid-90s on the mound) suddenly lost in high school has returned. 
His breaking ball recognition and bat control will continue to be tested by upper-level pitching, and if they start to show improvement, it's not only a sign that Adell is adjusting but that he has the capacity to do so in the future. At that point, we're talking prime Andrew McCutchen and Grady Sizemore-type tools.","tpQIfgNoqIE","sa3004837"

He has excellent plate discipline and an all-fields, gap-to-gap approach that suits his plus-plus speed; everything he slices down the line or sprays into the gap goes for extra-bases. Trammell also put on a shocking display during BP at the Futures Game and hit two absolute seeds during the game. He never did anything remotely like that in the Fall League (nor, frankly, did any of the other prospects who played in D.C. and then later in Arizona) and actually struggled to turn on balls there, but there's a chance of huge, if dormant, in-game power here, too. Though Trammell runs well enough to play center field (by a lot), his arm strength still might limit him to left field. That's where we have him projected, where we think he'll be a Carl Crawford or Brett Gardner type of defender. He projects as an excellent leadoff hitter with some pop, but there's a chance he ends up hitting for more power at some point.","M_E6U1FxIGw","sa917943"

Most importantly, his arm strength is once again viable at second base. An elbow injury relegated Hiura to DH-only duty as a junior at UC Irvine, and he may have gone even earlier in the 2017 draft if not for concerns about the injury and how it might limit his defense. That's no longer a concern, as Hiura has an average arm and plays an unspectacular second base. This is an incredible hitter. He has lightning-quick hands that square up premium velocity and possesses a rare blend of power and bat control. Hiura's footwork in the box is a little noisier than it has to be, and if any of his swing's elements are ill-timed, it can throw off the rest of his cut. This, combined with an aggressive style of hitting, could cause him to be streaky. But ultimately he's an exceptional hitting talent and he's going to play a premium defensive position. We think he's an All-Star second baseman.","uYT5GJncl_8","20003"

As is the case with many Louisville commits, his asking price was high. He got to campus and took such an immediate step forward that he was invited to play for college Team USA after just his freshman year. His tools steadily progressed and entering his draft spring, McKay was showing effortless 65-grade raw power, and above-average raw stuff on the mound. On draft day, we think a slight majority of teams preferred McKay as a hitter (the two of us were split). But every MLB team had him as a first round talent both ways, so it seemed inevitable that he would be the rare player who would get a chance to do both in pro ball so his team could at least have time to determine which path was the right one if he couldn't do both. That open-minded approach has driven how Tampa Bay has developed McKay. In 2018, his offense was fine -- he was unlucky by advanced and TrackMan metrics -- while he really broke out as a pitcher, regularly showing all the best stuff that he had only flashed in college. McKay leaned on a low-to-mid-90s fastball and didn't have trouble navigating lineups because of his above average to plus command of the pitch. A plus-flashing curveball is his best secondary offering, but his cutter and changeup are both above-average, giving him No. 2 or 3 starter upside, and he's not a long way off from reaching it. Shohei Ohtani's usage is the only precedent for how McKay might be handled: a standout, playoff rotation-caliber starter and DH. Given how baseball is valuing first base/DH players, there appears to be much more value on the mound for McKay, but there's still a real chance he turns into something like a 110 wRC+ hitter who could make a club just on the merits of his hitting and fielding ability as a first baseman, and scouts have always raved about his makeup and work ethic. The most exciting scenario would be if Tampa Bay paired him with a two-way righty (Tanner Dodson was a high pick in 2018 that will play both ways) and pull the gambit Joe Maddon has tried before: rotating righty and lefty pitchers between the mound and a spot in the field based on the matchups. It could be an effective strategy on its own while enabling roster flexibility in other areas, and it saves matchup relievers until later in the game. Of course, nobody wants the Rays to get too cute and spoil what might just be a traditional, mid-rotation profile.","aCKSVKfZpv0","20186"

Things seem to be moving at a different pace for Keibert, especially on defense. He has a thick, unimpressive build and is a mediocre athlete, but almost all of his baseball skills are elite. He's one of the better receivers in the minors and is a better ball blocker than one would expect given his lack of athleticism, as if he has wild pitch precognition. Despite average pure arm strength, Ruiz is going to snipe a lot of would-be base-stealers because his throws are almost always right on the bag. 
The skills-over-tools coloration of Ruiz's profile continues on offense, where his hand-eye coordination and bat control make him extraordinarily hard to strike out. He struck out in just 8% of his plate appearances last year as a 19/20-year-old at Double-A Tulsa. Because Ruiz can make contact with just about anything, he tries to, and his lack of selectivity will likely limit his big league power output and perhaps his ability to reach base. But he has a very rare skillset for a catcher and a good chance to be an All-Star.","jGl4H285JjI","sa872528"

By the end of the summer, scouts had seen enough from Kiriloff and Bo Bichette to convince them that these swings could work, and that Kirilloff and Bichette belonged in the top few rounds, with both continuing to exceedexpectations. Kirilloff went in the middle of the first round in 2016, and missed time immediately after playing his first 55 pro games with Tommy John surgery. 
He came back for his first full season in 2018 and dominated both Low-A and High-A, hitting over .330 at both stops with 20 homers on the season and strikeout rates below league average. There's some chance he is even more than just a 60 hitter with 55 or 60 power, which is what most scouts are projecting right now, with something like a 15-20% chance that Kirilloff turns into the next Joey Votto. There's some disagreement about whether his 2018 season was him dominating pitching that didn't challenge him, or if he has an approach that's a little too aggressive and he just got away with it in 2018. Kirilloff is a fringy runner who's an average defender in right field and has a plus arm, but he may bulk up and move to first base down the line, which would likely come with more power as well.","l3xPPnRQA7o","sa917929"

After that rough first start, his stuff and command were as they usually are. He was generating upper-90s velocity with ease, his breaking balls were crisp, and his changeups were well-located and moving. He walked just seven hitters in his final seven starts of the year before succumbing to elbow inflammation, which ended his regular season in early-June. Sanchez rehabbed in Florida in anticipation of an Arizona Fall League assignment and threw some tune up innings early during the 2018 fall instructional league, his stuff intact and ready for Arizona. Then he awoke one morning with soreness in his collarbone. After an MRI it was determined that Sixto would have to shut things down for a bit and head to Arizona quite late, so he was just shelved for the year. Sanchez has now missed time to injury in two consecutive seasons. In each year, he has often been given extended rest between starts and dealt with issues in his neck and collarbone area. That isn't ideal and all else being equal, we'd rather have a pitching prospect without this kind of injury history. But all else isn't equal when one lines up Sixto's stuff and command, both of which are very advanced for a conversion arm so new to pitching, against the stuff and command of other minor league pitchers.

Kieboom didn't hit well during his two-month stay in Harrisburg and he didn't look very good at shortstop in the Fall League, but he has performed much better than expected for a hitter who is the age of a college sophomore. He is going to stay on the infield, and has big, playable raw power, and we're unconcerned about his late-season struggles. Kieboom's hands work in a tight, explosive circle, which generates all-fields thump and enables Kieboom to catch up to premium velocity. He's a little heavy-footed on defense but his arm plays on the left side of the infield and his mediocre range might be able to be hidden by modern defensive positioning. This is a complete player with a chance to hit in the middle of the order and also stay at shortstop, if not second or third base. That's a potential All-Star.","_-90cLZAZz4","19958"

The industry's six-week look at Pache during the Arizona Fall League further cemented the belief that Pache has a great chance to be one of the, if not the, best defensive center fielders in baseball as soon as he arrives in Atlanta. He's a plus to plus-plus runner with a great first step, and he has a knack for contorting his body in ways that enable him to make spectacular catches on flyballs that would otherwise fall in for tough-luck hits. He also has a 70-grade arm when he sets and throws properly, though at times he sacrifices velocity and accuracy in order to get rid of the ball more quickly, which isn't always the right decision. Pache also has good bat-to-ball skills and solid average raw power, but the quality of his at-bats and his hitting mechanics both vary. His upside is enormous if everything comes together, and Pache just turned 20 years old, but there's risk that the bat plays down because of Pache's approach. If that's the case, he might exist in the Hamilton/Pillar area of WAR production, but even a one-dimensional offensive profile likely results in star level production and because Pache is still just the age of a college sophomore, we anticipate growth in this area.","ALCsGpZ1oiA","sa916722"

The younger Hayes was identified as a potential early-round pick pretty early in high school and eventually climbed to the back of the first round after a strong senior spring. He was drafted 32nd overall and signed for $1.8 million rather than head to Tennesse, where he and Nick Senzel would have played together for a year. Hayes has moved through the minors quickly and had a strong 2018 season at Double-A Altoona -- .293/.375/.444 with an 11% BB%, 16.5% K%, 31 2Bs, 12 SB -- in what would have been his draft year. He's one of the best defensive third basemen in the minors and has progressed to become an above-average hitter, as well. A flat-planed swing and conservative hitting footwork are stifling the in-game power production. For Hayes, that's fine. He does everything else. 
It's possible the Pirates will try to coax more power of out him by tweaking either his footwork or by moving his hands, the latter of which feels riskier. Even without further offensive evolution, Hayes projects as an all-fields, league-average offensive threat with plus-plus defense.","o76lKnW1nX0","sa874730"

His mid-90s fastball plays up due to great extension, and further incorporation of a running two-seamer has given May's heater enough tail to miss bats in the strike zone. His vertically-breaking slider (May calls it a slider, but it has curveball shape) has one of the better spin rates in the minors and enough vertical depth to miss bats against both left and right-handed hitters. It's May's out pitch, but he also has a developing cutter and its movement is a great foil for his two-seamer. After trying several different changeup grips in 2017, it seems like May is still searching for a good cambio, but his fastball and breaking ball command should suffice against lefties for now. 
The leg kick makes May slow to home and he may be vulnerable to the stolen base because of it, which forces him to vary his cadence home in an attempt to stymie runners.

He is mechanically non-traditional, something Gore is able to maintain because he's such a great athlete. As his front leg kicks up before he pedals toward the plate, so too does his glove and pitching hand, way up over his head, as if his mitt and knee are connected by an invisible wire. When Gore comes home, he drifts toward the first base side of the mound a bit, creating a unique angle on his pitches. 
And those pitches are good. Though he doesn't have great natural ability to spin the ball, Gore's over-the-top arm slot enables him to get tumble on his curveball anyway, he has very advanced changeup feel, and his slider is firm. He'll be able to locate what he wants, where he wants for as long as he retains his top-of-the-scale athleticism. He may be on a bit of an innings count this year just because he only threw 66 innings in 2018, but otherwise he's quite advanced and could move through the minors fairly quickly.

A creative sequencer, Honeywell's deep, unique repertoire is unlike any other pitcher in the minors. Though his fastball touches 98, his stuff is so diverse that he never has to pitch off of it. He can lob his curveball in for strikes, induce weak contact early in counts by throwing a cutter when hitters are sitting fastball, and he'll double and triple up on the changeup. What you see listed in Honeywell's tool grades as a splitter is actually a screwball. It wobbles home in the 79-82 mph range, while his true changeup is usually a little harder than that. The screwgie is more than a gimmick and can miss bats, though it’s best in moderation because it's a little easier to identify out of his hand, and hitters are able to recognize it after seeing it multiple times in the same at-bat. Honeywell's delivery is pretty violent and his TJ was not his first injury, but he's ready and has No. 2 or 3 starter stuff if it comes back after the surgery.

He is an elite athlete with acute baseball instincts, a dynamic up-the-middle defensive profile, and mature feel for the strike zone.

His fastball was only in the 88-92 range at Area Codes, though his changeup and curveball were each above-average. He did not throw during the fall and instead devoted more time to working out. The following spring, with a new physique, Luzardo's stuff was way up across the board, his fastball now sitting comfortably in the mid-90s, touching 97. Four starts into his senior season, Luzardo tore his UCL and need Tommy John. 
After most of the first three rounds of the 2016 draft had come and gone it seemed as though Luzardo might end up at the University of Miami. Four outings (including the one during which he broke) was not enough time for many teams to have high-level decision makers in to see him and take him early, but the Nationals (who have a history of drafting pitchers who have fallen due to injury) called his name and signed him for $1.4 million, a bonus equivalent to an early second rounder. Luzardo rehabbed as a National and continued to strengthen his body. When he returned the following summer, his stuff had completely returned. He made just three starts for the GCL Nats before he was traded to Oakland as part of the Sean Doolittle/Ryan Madson deal. 
He has quickly climbed Oakland's minor league ladder and reached Triple-A at age 20 in 2018. Those crafty pitchability traits from high school are still extant. Luzardo will vary the shape of his breaking ball -- he can throw it for strikes to get ahead of hitters, he back foot it to righties -- and he uses his changeup against lefties and righties. His delivery is a bit violent but it doesn't inhibit his command, and Luzardo's musculature seems better able to deal with the effort than it was when he was in high school. His fastball, which has been up to 97 in his big league appearances this spring, may not play like a mid-90s heater because he is undersized and a short-strider, but he locates it well enough to avoid getting hurt. 
He has mid-rotation upside and is abnormally polished. We may see him in Oakland this year.","XPMeIpPKW2k","19959"

But Dansby Swanson, Alex Bregman, Andrew Benintendi, and fellow Florida prep hitter Kyle Tucker all took steps forward in the spring, and the Rockies were able to get Rodgers third overall. 
In pro ball, Rodgers has benefitted form the Rockies' affiliates being extreme hitters' environments, which has mostly obscured in the surface stats the fact that Rodgers pitch selection is below average. It improved a bit in his second taste of Double-A in 2018, then became an issue again in his late-season promotion to Triple-A. He's fringy at shortstop and as a runner, so most scouts see him sliding over to second base long-term, but he's good enough to play shortstop everyday if a club doesn't have better options and focuses on shifting and positioning around him.

His stuff is great, headlined by a mid-90s fastball that often crests 100 mph. The command inroads Kopech made late in 2018 are especially important for his ability to deal with lefties, because his changeup feel is not very good. He'll need to mix his two breaking balls together to deal with them, and his slider feel is way ahead of the curveball.

His command improved and he added an 87-90 mph cutter that quickly became a plus pitch, to pair with his mid-90's fastball, above average slider, and plus splitter. After pitching for Team USA the summer before the draft, Mize got a PRP injection in his pitching elbow. Some teams had concerns about his shoulder in high school, and he also missed time a sophomore at Auburn with forearm tightness. 
Mize has some violence to his delivery and isn't the prototypical projectable plus athlete you normally see at the top of the draft. There's also some anecdotal evidence suggesting heavy cutter usage leads to diminished velocity. These are all things to make you wonder how Mize projects, but right now he may be able to pitch in the big leagues, with some mentioning Aaron Nola as the type of pitcher he could become. He's already made an adjustment to his slider that has given the pitch 
more verticl depth, like a slurve, which adds a new movement wrinkle to his mix.  He doesn't really fit Detroit's timeline for contention, and may not be as good in his sixth year of control as he'll be in his second, so many have openly wondered if Mize becomes a trade chip once he succeeds in the big leagues.

For two long weekends in Arizona he did everything. He crushed balls in all parts of the strike zone, ran plus-plus times to first base, and made several highlight reel defensive plays at second base. The wrist fracture kept him out for the rest of February, all of March, and most of April. When he returned, Madrigal kept hitting, but not for power, which is consistent with what plagues hitters for several months after they've had a break in the hand/wrist area. 
That trend continued through his first pro summer, which was interrupted by a hamstring issue, as Madrigal struggled to pull and/or lift the ball at all. He had a downward, slashing swing instead of the dynamic and athletic cut he'd had early in the year, when he could scoop and lift stuff at the bottom of the zone. But he kept making contact. It was a month before a pro pitcher was able to strike Madrigal, who only K'd in 3% of his pro plate appearances last year, out. 
It's fair to make a distinction between prospects who are small, and ones who are just short. Jose Altuve is short, but is built like a little tank. Madrigal is small, a diminutive 5-foot-7, 165 pounds, and this, combined with his total lack of post-draft power, has the pro side of scouting very concerned. He looked tired and sluggish during instructional league, though it wasn't as if he'd played a whole year and was an obvious candidate to be run down, furthering concerns that his size will be an issue.

The Marlins signed him for $400,000 as an eight rounder and traded him to San Diego just over a year later in exchange for Fernando Rodney. The six starts Paddack made leading up to the deal were incredible. He had a 48:2 strikeout to walk ratio during that span, and he has continued to miss bats while filling up the strike zone since the Padres acquired him. He'd probably have been in the majors last year had Tommy John surgery not robbed him of more than a year of development (Paddack blew out in his third ever start as a Padres prospect). 
His stuff was fine when he returned last year, with his fastball up to 95 in his first extended spring training start back from injury, and he topped out at 98 during the year. He'll likely never have a great breaking ball, but as long as he locates it properly against righties, it will be enough. If there's an 80 changeup in the minors, this is probably it, and plenty of starters with mediocre breaking balls have survived with heavy changeup use. Paddack's fastball plays in the strike zone and he can make it sink if he wants to work down, so he shouldn't run into any game theory-related issues due to a lack of repertoire depth because his stuff is just too good to hit when he locates it, even if you properly guess what's coming.

Those aspects of his defense have vastly improved, and he's now an average defender with a chance to be above, and his arm douses opposing baserunners. 
Murphy also has plus raw power, though he hasn't typically hit for it in games for various reasons. In college, a broken hamate likely masked his power and was part of the reason he fell to the 2016 draft's third round. In pro ball, his swing has been very compact, relying on Murphy's raw strength rather than efficient biomechanical movement to deliver extra-bases. He broke his other hamate last year. Murphy's nearly .500 SLG at Double-A Midland is above what we expect moving forward, and instead think Murphy will be a high-contact bat with doubles power, which would be an above-average regular behind the plate.","tVv3ORj53mQ","19352"

Wright mixes in a curveball and changeup that are tertiary options and his lower slot matches the sinker/slider combo a bit better. His best route to early big league success may be to lean on his breaking ball and throw it as often as his fastball, like Chris Archer or Patrick Corbin do. Given the Braves young pitching depth, there may not be a rotation spot for Wright, but his stuff and approach would definitely work in a multi-inning relief role until that spot is available.","e4af0nTNiFI","19665"

Puk was soft-bodied and relatively unathletic as an amateur, but he arrived to Mesa in good shape and his landing leg was more stable throughout his delivery, leading to superior command than he had had at Florida. Additionally, Puk dusted off his high school curveball and reintroduced it to his repertoire. His feel for it returned very quickly, and it was comfortably average near the end of spring and gave him a fresh way of starting off at-bats the second and third time through a lineup. His changeup was also better than it had been in college, and looked like a potential plus pitch. 
Scouts thought he had a chance to reach Oakland by year's end, and a surprisingly competitive Oakland club would have been motivated to move him quickly.

He made the leap between his sophomore and junior years, growing into his athleticism and developing plus raw power along with above average defensive tools and arm strength. The defensive tools are especially rare for a catcher of Bart's size, as it's much easier for a more compact-framed player to excel behind the plate. Bart has the rare ability to slow the game down defensively and scouts rave about his makeup, game calling, and game preparation. 
At the plate, Bart has big power and gets to it pretty often in games, particularly to his pull side, where he hit a majestic shot that was never found over the facade of the football complex in left field at Georgia Tech's stadium. But while he is exceptional behind the plate, Bart doesn't have the same ability to slow the game at it, however, with elevated strikeout rates in his draft year and just okay pitch selection. The bat speed is good and he doesn't have trouble against velocity, and some scouts point to his solid pro debut as evidence that Bart was just frustrated by being pitched around and developed some bad habits in college. Since literally everything else you could want except for contact is already present, most assume that Bart will figure out a way to get to a 40 to 50 bat with above average game power and above average defense, even if it's on the job in the big leagues in 2020.

He's added a full ten ticks to his fastball over the last two and a half years, and now is not only one of the best on-mound athletes in the minors, but a hard worker and team leader with infectious charisma. Patiño's velocity came as he got in the weight room and added about 25 pounds. He was so dominant during his first few pro starts in the DSL that the Padres quickly pushed him stateside for the remainder of 2017, then to the Midwest League at age 18 the following year. 
Not only does Patiño have premium arm strength, but he has natural feel for spin, and is a curious learner who quickly actualizes instruction on the mound. He has already begun to vary the cadence of his delivery to mess with hitters' timing, and has mapped aspects of MacKenzie Gore's delivery to his own, just to see if it works for him. He's still a little too confident with his breaking ball in the zone, but it's hard not to expect an athlete with work habits like these (Patiño has already learned and is fluent in English) to get better at everything. You can go nuts projecting on his secondaries and command the same way scouts did with Hunter Greene when he was in high school, and Patiño's breaking stuff is further along than Greene's was at the same age. He likely won't grow into more velo because the frame for that isn't here, but he's already got plenty of heat. Conservatively, Patiño has mid-rotation upside, but how the changeup and breaking ball command develop matter because that's where there's room for significant growth.","k11tj7Ee2qs","sa3002792"

His signing with Chicago marked the end of a more lucrative era for young international players who are now subject to more tight-fisted rules capping bonus amounts. Despite a limited market due to the timing of his deal, Robert signed for $26 million thanks to his all-world physical gifts. The raw power and top-end speed were obvious in workouts, but unless teams scouted him in Series Nacional or during the Cuban National team's annual CanAm League tour, little was known about his ability to hit big league-quality pitching, or what his instincts were like in center field. 
Because his thumb cost him April, May, and July (he re-aggravated it), it was hard to get extended looks during 2018 until Robert's six-week stint in the Arizona Fall League (which was also interrupted by a hamstring issue). LouBob's AFL stats were fine, but his swing path left him vulnerable to velocity on the inner half, and he too often expanded the zone. There's doubt that he'll get to all of his raw power in games, both due to the swing path and lack of plate discipline, but it isn't as if he's had time to make proper adjustments yet, and the pitching he saw in Arizona was the best he's seen in his life. The ceiling is the same as it was purported to be before he signed: power, speed, offensive performance similar to Carlos Gomez's best years. There's just more risk that Robert doesn't get there.","yolHGuJGfEk","sa3003396"

When he departed his May 30 start after four innings, he had thrown exactly 50 career frames. The MLB rule for rookie eligibility states that it has been exceeded when a pitcher has thrown more than 50 innings, so he's technically still eligible. Reyes has developed amid constant setbacks. He had a shoulder injury in 2015, a marijuana suspension that spanned the 2015 Fall League and start of the 2016 season, underwent Tommy John later in 2016 and then suffered a right lat ligament detachment in his first big league start back from TJ in 2018. The surgery to reattach his ligament took place in early June, which, with a six month recovery, means Reyes should be ready for 2019. Healthy Reyes is one of the best arm talents on the planet. His fastball will sit 93-97 and hover near 100 out of the bullpen. He'll also show you a plus changeup and curveball. His feel for each can be inconsistent, which is understandable given how little he has pitched over the last three years. If fully realized, Reyes has top of the rotation stuff. It's unclear how St. Louis will usher Reyes along next spring, both as far as his role and workload are concerned. He has the stuff to be a dominant multi-inning or high-leverage relief arm should the Cardinals think he's more likely to stay healthy that way. His innings total will likely need to be manicured somehow, and perhaps that's the way to go about building Reyes back up even if the org considers him a traditional starter long term.","Z_2KQ7Utxy4","15015"

His indicators were positive--plate discipline, contact skills, bat speed, enough power to profile--and we were high on Lowe entering the year, pegging him as a 45 FV. He went off in 2018, following a fine Double-A look in 2017 by demolishing the level in 2018, then performing even better at Triple-A, earning a big league look, where he put up almost 1.0 WAR in just 43 games. The offense has taken off even more than those highest on him internally had expected, with some chance for 50 hit and 60 game power with passable defense at second, along with versatility to play left field and possibly first base if needed. Lowe is now in the weird prospect spot where he isn't the highly-drafted, tooled-up brand name type you typically find in the middle of a top 100, but he's about as low risk of a bat as there is with prospect eligibility, and he can also play up the middle, so his six years of control have tons of value to a small market team like the Rays.","ZlJ75nn6Qok","18882"

He had a similarly strong 2018, which included a Futures Game invite, a .390 OBP at Triple-A, and then a strong 30-game big league stint in August and September, all reinforcing that Jansen's 2017 breakout was legitimate. A solid if unspectacular defender, Jansen's pop times were depressed during his big league cameo, hovering between 2.05 and 2.10, both below average for a catcher. But he's an average receiver and ball-blocker, and is a perfectly acceptable defensive catcher without a disqualifying shortcoming. 
Where Jansen shines is in the batter's box. His hands work in a tight loop, giving Jansen the capacity to catch velocity and still lift the baseball, and he's strong enough to muscle out balls to his pull-side, though to this point his approach has yielded more doubles than homers. He is a pull-only plodder and he'll likely always be a low BABIP guy, and it's possible major league pitchers will find ways to attack him in ways that limit his power output, but he's going to make a lot of contact and reach base, which, at catcher, could make him an All-Star.","g2cf5HtQ084","16535"

In addition to clubbing the most home runs, Alonso hit some of 2018's loudest individual blasts. He had the most prolific batting practice session at the Futures Game, then threatened a passing satellite with a titanic seventh-inning homer off of a grooved, 95mph Adonis Medina fastball. He exceeded Mets Statcast-era records on a ball in play in the Arizona Fall League, out-hit Vlad Guerrero, Jr. during Fall Stars BP, then homered the opposite way off a 103mph Nate Pearson fastball in the game. This is what top-of-the-scale, strength-driven raw power looks like, and it drives an excellent version of a profile we're typically quite bearish on: the heavy-bodied, right/right first baseman. Alonso is tough to beat with velocity because his swing is compact and even when he's a little late, he's capable of muscling mis-hit balls out the other way. After some adjustment, Fall League pitching chose to attack him beneath the knees, and well-located pitches down there were successful, but Alonso crushes mistake breaking balls that catch too much of the zone. We think a typical Alonso season will look like something between what C.J. Cron and Jesus Aguilar did last year, depending on whether the 2018 uptick in Alonso's walk rate holds water or not. He makes some nice effort-based plays at first base, but as a feet and hands athlete, Alonso is well below average. Perhaps more notable than what we anticipate will be several years of mashing in the heart of the Mets lineup, Alonso is a favorite to become the poster child for player compensation reform. Already near the center of public discourse regarding teams' suppression of prospect promotion, Alonso is 24 years old and has a skillset and body type at heightened risk to enter physical decline relatively early. With his early-career earning power stifled by his parent club, Alonso might start to show signs of physical regression during his arbitration years and also struggle to find a lucrative market in free agency. His free agency is timed awkwardly between what will probably be the next two CBA negotiations, but otherwise the circumstances indicate his situation could one day be a focal point for change.","Yr1fm8IK4nw","19251"

He looked like a well-rounded, first-division player while he was hitting with pleasantly surprising power (.282/.343/.432 with 30 extra-base hits in 85 games) at Hi-A St. Lucie during the season's first half, but like much less of one during a rough six weeks in the Arizona Fall League. In Fall League, Gimenez looked physically overmatched at the plate, likely due to exhaustion. He was still 19 when the Mets promoted him to Double-A for the season's final six weeks, and his sophomoric body had endured a 122-game season against older, more physically developed athletes before he had even set foot in Arizona. It's fair to project Gimenez to add strength, but because his frame is small, it'll probably be just the kind of strength that gives him season-long stamina, not huge raw power. But while big raw power is unlikely, if his feel for contact is refined in a way that prioritizes lift, it's possible that Gimenez will end up hitting for more power than we project in the same way Ozzie Albies has. Gimenez has excellent natural bat control and can pull his hands in to get the barrel on pitches that would jam other hitters, and he has feel for fully extending on balls away from him and roping them into the opposite-field gap. If he does, he might end up hitting a ton of doubles and out-slug our projections without hitting a lot of home runs, or he may naturally start lifting the ball like Albies did. In general, we like Gimenez as an above-average defensive middle infielder with advanced contact skills. We think he'll be a solid-average everyday player, and while we think it's unlikely, we can see a developmental path that leads to better production than that.","0daljrqAYUs","sa917114"

He has a very aggressive approach and a funky, high-effort swing from both sides of the plate, and they're only sustainable because Mejia has elite hand-eye coordination and bat control. His swing-happy approach could limit his on-base ability quite a bit, and possibly his power output, too, which would be less of a problem if Mejia could definitely stick as a catcher. Mejia has an elite arm but is a below-average receiver currently. 
Before they traded him, Cleveland tried Mejia at third base and the outfield corners. San Diego seems inclined to just let him catch, but if Wil Myers' defensive movement is any indication, they're open to trying new things. There are probably certain types of pitchers that Mejia can catch without much issue, and it seems logical to pair him and Austin Hedges in a way that hides Mejia's issues while he can work on them and still gets reps. If he does have to move to, say, right field, the lack of plate discipline becomes an issue because the offensive bar out there is much higher. The scouting report reads much like Jorge Alfaro's, except Mejia is a switch-hitter with better natural bat control.","zjm3SlBQSVM","16403"

This, combined with some injuries (an oblique strain in 2017, shoulder stiffness in 2018) and the way Sheffield's body has thickened, has led some scouts to conclude that Sheffield will eventually be a reliever, albeit a very good one due to the quality of his stuff. We don't think his fastball is going to miss as many bats as you might expect given it's velocity. It's a mid-90s bowling ball sinker with well-below average spin rate. This should pair well with Sheffield's changeup, but it may not effectively set up his slider, which on its own is excellent.

He body-comps more closely to someone like Harold Carmichael or Brandon Ingram than he does anyone in his own sport, and there are several vastly different ideas as to how his body and game will develop as he fills out. Despite his ectomorphic build, lever length, and physical immaturtiy, Cruz has performed and has handled aggressive assignments pretty well. The Dodgers sent him to Low-A Great Lakes when he was 18, where he ran into 20 extra-base hits in 90 games before being traded to Pittsburgh at the deadline for Tony Watson. He hit .286/.343/.488 in 2018 while repeating Low-A. 
There's real risk Cruz maxes out as a 40 bat, but as long as he's getting to most of that power, he'll likely profile just about anywhere on the defensive spectrum. So, where exactly on the defensive spectrum will that be? Shortstops this big don't exist, but there's some sentiment in the industry that Cruz will be able to stay there, especially as we enter the era of the lead-footed shortstop. Others consider Cruz's speed viable in center field long term. Those who think he'll thicken significantly have him projected to either right field or third base, and others think his size would make for a wonderful target at first. One source thinks Cruz should just be pitching, due to his arm strength and athleticism. Clearly this is one of the more bizarre prospects in baseball with countless possible career outcomes. Most of them are very positive or highly entertaining; several of them end in stardom.","GzwLKufiG4A","sa917318"

He popped up seemingly out of nowhere as a sophomore at a lesser Florida junior college but quickly entered the first round discussion when JuCo ball kicked off in January of 2017. As the draft approached, Pearson was showing better secondary stuff in games and bumping 100 mph in bullpen sessions for scouts. He forced his way up draft boards even though teams had little history with him, and some were skeptical of the new velocity or concerned it would lead to injury. 
Pearson made seven short but dominant appearances in the Northwest League during the summer and was poised to begin 2018 at Hi-A Dunedin (an aggressive assignment), but he suffered an intercostal strain and began the season on the DL. In his final extended spring rehab start, he was sitting 94-96 and touching 98 with the fastball. He finally toed a Florida State League rubber that week and lasted 1.2 innings before a comebacker struck his wrist and forearm and fractured his ulna. The injury ended his regular season after just five outs. 
After rest and some rehab during instructs, Pearson went to Arizona for the Fall League. His stuff was electric there, his fastball always sitting 95-99 and cresting 100 mph often. He threw a 104 mph fastball and a 95 mph slider during the Fall Stars game, and he was able to dump his upper-70s curveball in for strikes throughout his six-week tenure, though he threw no changeups. Pearson was also horribly wild at times. It's fair to conclude that rust was to blame for his occasional wildness but because the pro side of the industry has seen so little of Pearson, it's impossible to know for sure. 
There's a strong possibility that he just ends up in the bullpen, but if he does and he breathes one-inning fire like he did during Fall Stars, he basically has Aroldis Chapman's stuff (though perhaps not the same extension or approach angle). Provided he stays healthy, Pearson's future is bright, albeit unclear. He's likely to be handled with care for a while in order to keep him healthy and manage his workload after what was essentially a lost 2018, but given the wide variance and top shelf stuff, there is still frontline starter potential.","t_D8-uewjYw","sa3005097"

His 2018 included eight sterling starts in Low-A and 11 very solid starts in Hi-A, all as a teenager. 
Graterol has the making of a frontline starter, sitting 96-99 and hitting 100 mph often, mixing in a plus-flashing slider and a changeup that's above average at its best. He's a short strider and a bit of a dart-thrower, which is unusual for a pitcher that hits 100, but it helps Graterol throw more strikes than you would assume from a teenager hitting this kind of heat with an arm surgery in his past. The poor extension makes his velocity play lower than the radar gun readings, but with some incremental improvements in pitch execution and command, Graterol could shoot up our overall list, as he does more things like Sixto Sanchez than anyone else in the minors.","5VxhHnSA2hg","20367"

Some clubs think he'll move to right field, and the contact issues Jones has had due to his lever length are problematic if he doesn't stay at third.
We're intrigued by the three-true outcomes possibilities here, as Jones already has huge power and might grow into more, and he's also had some of the higher walk rates in all of the minor leagues. Opposing pitchers are going to have to be careful with him or risk paying a 400 foot price, so we expect his on base ability to hold water at the upper levels.

During the spring, Bohm steadily worked his way up from the late first round to the third overall pick by hitting more than scouts expected a long-limbed power threat to hit. Bohm pulls this off by keeping his arms tucked in during his swing and having a flatter plane; as a result he's both quicker into the zone and in the zone longer than most power hitters. Ideally, hitters with Bohm's plus-plus power have more loft in their swing plane and extend their arms to generate the most power, with Kris Bryant an example of a hitter with a similar frame and this more power-focused approach. We're projecting Bohm as a 50 bat with 60 game power and split the difference a bit--he could go even more extreme for power at the expense of contact--but there are a number of ways this offensive skillset could turn out, particularly with new and more progressive hitting instruction this year for the Phillies. Bohm's defense also could go a few different ways, depending how much weight he adds to his lean frame and how his lateral quickness ages. Defensively, Bohm looks major league average at times and clearly below average at others, but he'll get plenty of chances to make things work at third base.","GOKNy9Trues","sa3007284"

He moved to the rotation in March and crosscheckers started showing up to see him much later than is typical for a first look at a second round talent. In 2018, his first full season as a member of the rotation, Howard thrived and late in the year his stuff took off. After two dominant months to close his regular season, Howard threw a no hitter in the Sally League playoffs. During that stretch, he was sitting 94-98 for much of his starts and flashing three good secondary pitches, the best of which is a disappearing, low-80s changeup. Howard can also freeze hitters with a mid-70s curveball and use it to get ahead, and his mid-80s slider has enough length to miss bats away from righties. Though he has below average fastball command, Howard's ability to throw his breaking balls for strikes significantly improves his chances of starting. His inning count in 2018 (112) was about the same as it was if you combine his college and pro workload from 2017, and it's fair to assume that even if Philly wants to him to throw more innings, an innings cap might impede a 2019 debut, even if Howard's stuff is ready.

Hall has also made on-field progress throughout 2018. Early in the season, he was wild.

Amaya's hands have life, and work in a tight little loop as he accelerates them to swing. He can pull and lift balls in various parts of the zone with regularity, and the impact of his contact is only limited by his average bat speed. The physical grind of catching is likely to dilute his in-game offensive production a little bit, but unless the beating he takes back there starts to take away from his defensive abilities (which sometimes happens to young catchers), Amaya is a pretty good bet to have some kind of big league career, and, if the bat maxes out, he'll be an above-average regular. He turns 20 in March and will likely head to Hi-A next year.

Like a lot of Japanese pitchers, Kikuchi has a kitchen sink repertoire that features a splitter and various breaking balls. Everything is above-average, except for Kikuchi's fastball. Mechanically, Kikuchi is similar to MacKenzie Gore, although his stride direction is more direct to the plate and his delivery has a brief intermission as his landing leg descends (pause) then everything comes home. His arm action is efficient and Kikuchi's slot is vertical, something it seems that more analytically inclined teams prefer.

His contact rate was about the same until a late 2018 promotion to Triple-A, where he was exposed a bit. Scouts think there's an exploitable hole in his swing and that he's more of a .240-type hitter if he wants to keep hitting for power in games. He's still the same runner, defender, and thrower, and can reasonably play almost any position on the field, so even .240 with 20 homers would be a very valuable piece to a contending team, even more so than Austin Barnes.","PAOgaHuSvPg","19197"

He signed for a $15 million bonus -- the Dodgers paid a dollar-for-dollar tax on his deal for exceeding their pool limit -- during a CBA era that was more lucrative for international players. So advanced was Diaz that at age 19, the Dodgers saw fit to send him directly to Hi-A Rancho Cucamonga the following year, and he performed admirably for what amounted to a season and a half before enjoying a statistical breakout at Double-A Tulsa starting late in 2017. His stock and performance reached a pinnacle in 2018; Diaz slashed .314/.428/.477 with Tulsa, homered twice and won MVP at the Futures Game in July. Shortly thereafter he was traded to Baltimore as the headline prospect in the Manny Machado deal. 
Diaz has a well-rounded collection of average tools that, in aggregate, promise to make him a valuable everyday big leaguer. He has slowly whittled down what was once a pretty big leg kick into something more simplistic, and it seems to have benefitted Diaz's timing without subtracting from his power. He can open up and get the bat head on pitches in, and he has feel for opposite-field contact if he's a little late on something away from him. We'd be surprised if Diaz became a 3-plus win annual WAR producer, but we think he's a very stable everyday outfield prospect who'll be big league ready in the next year and a half or so.","cdLpzBiXeNQ","sa912848"

This, combined with an ability to guide the barrel around the zone, drives a promising, contact-first offensive package that would be quite valuable at catcher. Knizner moved from shortstop (in high school) to third base (as a college freshman) to catcher (as a sophomore) and has been behind the plate for four seasons now. He remains below-average in most aspects of catching, but isn't so bad that he'll surely have to move. He's not nearly as skilled a defender as Carson Kelly, but Knizner has a much better chance to make an offensive impact. Yadier Molina is signed through 2020, which creates the illusion of a catching logjam, but he's somewhat fragile and Knizer and Kelly's experience at corner infield spots (Knizner has played some first base as a pro, but did not in 2018) could enable the Cardinals to carry all three of them at some point.

Right now, Tucker has surprising contact skills for someone as lanky as he is and he's adept at identifying balls and strikes. His size and currrent swing both have significant room for growth. Tucker's bat path enters the hitting zone in such a way that it causes him to pound the ball into the ground. If that gets tweaked, and he also adds strength into his mid-20s, he might suddenly start hitting for power. This is a rare, high-variance prospect who also has a high floor.

Then Bukauskas asked not to be drafted (he was, late, and didn't sign) so he could go to North Carolina. After a middling freshman year, he was dominant as a sophomore and in the early part of his junior year before his stuff was depressed during North Carolina's postseason games. It inflamed perviously held concerns that durability issues resulting from his size and a violent delivery might push Bukauskas to the bullpen. 
After parts of two pro seasons, we still don't have great feel for how Bukauskas will hold up under a pro workload. He hasn't had any arm issues, but missed two months due to a slipped disk in his thoracic spine, an injury he suffered in a car accident. Bukauskas was electric when he returned and became increasingly dominant towards the end of the summer before his stuff was seen by the entire industry in the Arizona Fall League. 
He'll flash 70-grade changeups and sliders on occasion, bump 98, and has added a cutter. His stuff would lose some zip late in Fall League outings, and he may be more of a 120-inning starter than true workhorse, which would cap his value at around 2.5 annual WAR.","KOAoxcF0A9E","sa829263"

He has made subtle changes to his lower half, drawing his front knee back toward his rear hip more than he did at Kentucky, and taking a longer stride back toward the pitcher.

Marsh had statistical success there and in the Midwest League the following spring, before finally scuffling at Hi-A. 
Though he has above-average raw power, Marsh's in-game cut is more contact-oriented, geared for contact to the opposite field and back up the middle.

Vientos performed fine in his pro debut, but broke out in his second year, crushing the Appalachian League at age 18 in 2018. He controlled the strike zone and hit for power while exhibiting very high exit velos for someone his age. Vientos is advanced mechanically, making him a potential 6 bat/6 power combination at maturity if he continues at this trajectory.

If the makeup has turned a corner and the hitting continues to progress, the main issue will be defensive fit. Vientos is a well below average runner who one scout described as ""athletic from the knees up,"" to the point where the lack of quickness will limit him to being average defensively, but he's far from that right now.

Of course, the reason each individual player has strikeout issues can vary. Some hitters have feckless, over-aggressive approaches, while others can't recognize breaking balls or have a problem with lever length and get tied up inside. Florial's issues -- his strikeout rate has fallen between 27% and 32% each of the last three years -- appear to stem from his bat path and limited bat control. Stiff wrists cause his bat head to drag into the zone, which can cause him to be tardy on fastballs at the letters and, more frequently, flail at soft stuff dipping down and away from him. Yoan Moncada has similar issues that have yet to be remedied. 
Florial does enough other stuff that, even if the strike outs remain an issue, he could still be a valuable big leaguer. He crushes anything down and in, has sufficient plate coverage to hit fastballs middle away, and has enough power to do damage to the opposite field. He also has good ball/strike recognition so, again like Moncada, there should be power, walks, and up-the-middle defense. We think Florial is likely to be an exciting but flawed everyday player, though it's not audacious to think his relative youth (he was a 20-year-old at Hi-A in 2018) and inexperience (he also missed a year of reps due to a suspension for bad paperwork) leave more room for growth than we anticipate.","mYK2ssfvC80","sa874464"

The questions then are still largely the questions now: he's a plus runner who can play a solid center field with average raw power, but scouts question how much offensive impact there will be. Cameron has already surpassed the expectations that pessimistic scouts had for him as an amateur, but even scouts that like him now say he's a potential low-end regular, possibly in the Keon Broxton mold, or even a poor man's version of his father.

He's hit for more power in pro ball than he ever did in college, probably because Long Beach's marine layer makes it more difficult to hit for power there, and also because the Rockies affiliates are all launching pads. It's hard to conclude that Hampson's minor league power output (.457 SLG, mostly via doubles and triples) won't continue because his future home is going to be Coors Field. He has also stolen way more bases as a pro than he did in college, peaking with 51 steals in 2017, and 38 last year.

He is polished for his age, not only in the batter's box but in center field, where he's very comfortable going back on balls.

Most amateur scouts had him projected to first base, but he now has a chance to not just stick in a corner outfield spot, but perhaps be above-average there. 
Really what Ornelas is best at is hitting. He has terrific timing and feel for contact, as well as a growing idea of which pitches to attack to hit for power. His ground ball rate was down last year and while there's still room for growth in this area, the fact that Ornelas has already shown movement here is a sign more will come. Unless the hit and power tools grow beyond what we expect, it's unlikely that Ornelas becomes a star, but we consider him a strong bet to be an everyday big leaguer, and his makeup and polish make him an unusually high-probability bet in our estimation.","fePwwNc6EwI","sa3004048"

It's incredible that Verdugo is athletic enough to make so much contact with this swing, but he still doesn't lift the ball very much, and probably maxes out with doubles power.

His strikeout rate in Arizona was 25% -- better than the summer, but still not great -- and he hit for almost no power there. His issues with strikeouts weren't, in our opinion, caused by excessive movement in his swing but rather by things like breaking ball recognition, bat path, and hand-eye coordination. Those aren't things that can be remedied by mechanical changes, and we'd rather an athlete like this be moving a lot at the plate to help ensure he's getting to as much of that power as possible, even if it means living with a lot of strikeouts.

Ray, long lauded for his makeup, made some adjustments to remedy the timing issues that plagued him in 2017. His front hip is clearing earlier, enabling him to catch some of the inside pitches that were tying him up last year. This has seemed to improve the quality of Ray's contact, but it hasn't remedied his strikeout issues. Ray struck out in 29.3% of his 2018 plate appearances and had a 17.5% swinging strike rate, the latter of which would rank as the 15th most frequent SwStr% in the majors last year. Ray swings through pitches in the zone fairly frequently and despite his prodigious physical abilities, his offensive profile feels unstable. His up-the-middle defensive profile gives him some wiggle room on offense, but he's not a very instinctive defender and is closer to average in center field than one might expect given his speed. Players can succeed despite heavy strikeouts; Chris Taylor's skillset looks an awful lot like Ray's (power, strikeouts, and a pedestrian defense at a premium position) and Taylor was a 3 WAR player last year. Ray's peak could look like that. He's also similar to players like Franchy Cordero, Brad Zimmer, late-career Colby Rasmus, and an even longer list of hitters who also have lean years when they don't hit and produce closer to replacement level.

After struggling to lay off of breaking balls early in 2017, he has become more patient, and his walk rate was much higher last year. Even though he didn't hit for much power in the Cal League, the Angels promoted him to Double-A for the last two months of the season, then gave him some run in the Arizona Fall League. 
Jones' general lack of performance last year should not yet concern readers, as he went through several swing changes, with the Angels constantly tweaking how and where his hands set up. He projects as a high-contact second baseman with doubles power unless one of these tweaks unlocks more in-game pop.","J40IH-lAmOs","sa874807"

His high school coach, Jered Goodwin, now a FIU assistant, ran arguably the top travel program in Florida at the time, so Mountcastle had year-round reps in front of scouts for years. He's still largely the same player he was in high school in terms of raw tools: plus bat control, plus raw power, with fringy speed and no clear defensive home because he has issues throwing. He's played mostly shortstop and third base in pro ball but scouts keep comparing his profile to Nick Castellanos' and think he ends up in left field. 
There's some optimism that his arm will improve with a throwing program, or that he could play second base (which is worth a try), but usually these situations end with the player at the lower end of the defensive spectrum. Like Castellanos, Mountcastle also is a little too aggressive at the plate but has the bat control to keep his strikeout rates from getting too high. The projection here is something like a 55 bat and 55 power, maybe a bit less if the approach doesn't continue to improve, with below average speed and defensive value, wherever he ends up playing. We wish he were a little choosier at the dish -- that's a lower-risk, 2 WAR-type prospect. Mountcastle will start 2019 in Triple-A, so the wait shouldn't be long.","Mf-E2t1dIxo","sa874734"

But Santillan was still a work-in-progress strike-thrower and most teams considered him a reliever. Cincinnati took him 49th overall. He has progressed well in pro ball, with the Reds' belief in his makeup and athleticism paying off, as he's gotten more consistent across the board and is now a little more likely to be a starter than reliever. He still mostly has the big stuff he flashed as a prep, though his velo and spin rates are slightly down. Santillan has mid-rotation upside, but his fallback options if the command/consistency doesn't work in a starter role would be an above-average multi-inning or high leverage reliever, which is much more valuable now than it was in 2015.

A converted catcher, with rare straight-line speed for a backstop but the stereotypically excellent catcher makeup, Long is still not a very good second baseman and has below average hands and clunky footwork. He has now been playing there regularly for three and a half seasons, and his development has plateaued. We still have him projected as a 45 defender at second base but also think there's an increased chance that he eventually moves to the outfield. It would be much easier for Long to profile were he to stay at second base, where big leaguers slashed a collective .254/.317/.395 (good for a 93 wRC+) in 2018. The outfield corners are not so kind.

On the brink of 21, Tejeda is the age of draftable college players. Coincidentally, this year's draft has a similar type of talent who is similarly aged in UNC-Wilmington shortstop, Greg Jones. Both Tejeda and Jones are speedy shortstops with rare power for the position who also have issues making contact. Tejeda is rangy and athletic, and has good defensive footwork and plenty of arm for the infield's left side. His hands are just okay, so evaluations of his defense can vary depending on what individual scouts think is important to play the position, and some teams want to see him tried in center field. 
Tejeda has plus-plus bat speed and his hands work in a tight, lift-friendly circle, but he's so explosive that at times he's out of control (this is where the strikeouts come from). He managed to get to the power at Hi-A in 2018, when he homered 19 times, and if he can stay at shortstop and continue to mash like that in games, he'll be a good everyday player. We have Greg Jones in the 45 FV tier of the 2019 draft, which puts him in the mid-to-late first round; we like Tejeda a bit more than that and think he'd be in the 10-15 range on a draft board.

But Siri has great bat speed, power, and an innate feel for impacting the bottom of the baseball and lifting it into the air. If he weren't so aggressive (he appeared to be under a mandate to see more pitches in 2018) he'd be an easy plus future hit, plus future power center field prospect in the middle of our top 100. But the volatility created by the impatience, combined with Siri's noticeably thicker 2018 frame, has created apprehension. His upside is huge, but so is the risk. Ultimately, he shares many traits with Phillies outfielder Nick Williams (though Siri's a better defender by a wide margin), and, like Williams, Siri might just be such an amazing offensive talent that he'll be fine eventually despite his issues and several developmental bumps in the road.

Built like, and as fast as, a bowling ball SEC running back, Ramos is going to stay in center field for a while but most scouts think he'll eventually move to a corner.

Luciano has explosive hands and a natural uppercut swing. He hits many more balls out during BP than is typical for a hitter this age, and has taken his peers deep in games, too. 
Luciano's feet and actions are workable on the infield but he struggles with throwing velocity and accuracy when he's forced to throw from a lower arm slot, as shortstops often are. If he can't correct that, he'll need to move to the outfield. If he can, this is a shortstop with 80 bat speed. Luciano is a potential superstar.

A polished strike-thrower with four good pitches, he reached Double-A as a 19-year-old back in 2017 before he became the centerpiece of the Justin Verlander deal. Advanced though he was, various injuries have robbed Perez of innings. He has yet to throw more than 86 frames in an entire season, so while he may be fairly advanced for someone his age, and definitely for someone who has pitched so little, the industry has yet to see his stuff hold up for a whole summer of starter's innings. 
In 2016, he had knee trouble; in 2018, it was a lat strain, then shoulder inflammation. An ominous trap issue popped up during the early parts of 2019 spring training but Perez was back on the mound quickly and sitting his usual 93-96 into late-March. A strong-bodied 21-year-old, the cement is likely dry on Perez's stuff. His high three-quarters slot creates ride to his fastball as well as downward vertical action on his curveball, and those two traits typically pair well together. While Perez's curveball is his prettiest pitch, his best secondary offering is the changeup. There are times when Perez will come across the baseball and create screwball action on the change, and it runs, sometimes unhittably, onto the glove side corner of the plate. But mostly, it's used as a swing-and-miss pitch that bottoms out beneath the strike zone just as it reaches the plate. Perez has mid-rotation stuff and strike-throwing ability, but needs a fully healthy season to be valued at that level across the league. ",,"sa873722"

Garcia could be next in line to jump into the 50 FV tier during the 2019 season, building on a solid pro debut in 2018, where he improved his already-impressive tool profile. To clarify any confusion, it's worth noting that there is another, very similar middle infield prospect with the Nationals of the same name who was also born in the same year. The Phillies' Garcia has an above average hit tool to go with above average speed, defense, and arm strength at shortstop, so it won't be a long journey to turn into a regular if he can maintain those current tools. He's played just 43 official minor league games and has an unsustainably-high .418 BABIP, but the performance also supports the standout skillset. Some scouts argue there isn't a plus tool here other than arm strength, so you can't stuff Garcia too high until he's done a little more in official games, but he's already among the top 200 prospects or so in baseball. Some see sneaky potential average raw power down the road, which Garcia could mostly get to in games if he ends up being the plus hitter that some are projecting, though some scouts see 45 hit and 40 power, given the limited pro looks they've had. It's also worth noting that Garcia has become close friends with Alec Bohm; the pair could team up to form half of the infield of the future in Philadelphia. Garcia will definitely be one to watch closely in 2019 as there's some in-season ceiling to his potential ranking, particularly if he can perform the way the Nationals' Luis Garcia did this past year; that Garcia reached High-A at age 18.","cVHO9Fx0oYc","sa3007295"

He's made some subtle changes to his swing but he's still mostly the same player he was in his draft year at Virginia. Haseley is fringy to average for most scouts in center field. His pitcher arm strength doesn't translate to the outfield, but he would be an above average left fielder if he can't stick in center. Like a few hitters in this system, a loft or approach change could shift the offensive profile a bit for Haseley, but he seems capable of a roughly 100 wRC+ (read: major league average at the plate), which is a solid regular if he can be average in center field.

In addition to consistently throwing the best version of his curveball, Denaburg also located it well for his age, often down in the zone.

He played at a couple of showcase events in the summer of 2017 and had some raw tools, but wasn't yet under consideration for the top few rounds of the baseball draft. He was, however, a top 100 football recruit, set to head to North Carolina to play wide receiver, where his father was on the coaching staff. Then in March, Adams had a coming out party at the heavily-scouted NHSI tournament near his high school, fulfilling the rosiest hopes some had of him eventually putting it together on the baseball field, as multiple scouts from all 30 teams watched him against strong competition for a few days. Scouts were hesitant at first, worried they might be overreacting, but eventually came to think that Adams' only athletic peer in recent draft history was Byron Buxton. 
Adams is a true 80 runner with raw power who projects to be a 60, and who flashed body and bat control that reminded scouts of Royce Lewis. All of this excitement came with almost zero track record, and Adams didn't face much strong competition after NHSI, meaning drafting him would be based purely on old-school scouting, as there weren't years of video of and performance from this flourishing incarnation of Adams. Once teams became enthused enough that multiple millions of dollars were in play, it appeared clear that baseball could overtake football. Several GMs, including the Angels' GM Billy Eppler, were in after NHSI to see Adams for themselves, and after Adell and Adams were their top pick in consecutive years, rival executives now view this risk/upside kind of prospect as Los Angeles' type. That trend appears to be more the result of opportunistic good fortune than a deliberate strategy, since there's an argument to be made that Austin Beck (who went to Oakland sixth overall in 2017) had less upside and a similar performance record to Adams; if the industry had simply seen Adams play in an NHSI-style setting for a couple more weeks, he could have been a top five pick candidate, just like Royce Lewis or Byron Buxton were after a strong summer of performance.

At times his fastball has been in the upper-90s, cresting 100, but it was in the low-90s this spring and he was placed on he injured list thereafter with an oblique issue. 
Gonsolin's four-pitch mix looks like it was designed in a lab and considering the way his stuff works together, it may have been.

He'll also work a slider to his glove side and it has shocking, horizontal length considering Gonsonlin's arm slot. But the headline offering here is the changeup, a split-action cambio that bottoms out as it reaches the plate. Gonsolin uses it against both left and right-handed hitters and it's one of the best changeups in the minors.

Because Rodriguez spent his 2018 summer in the DSL (which isn't heavily scouted) and Seattle eschews game action during instructional league, if people in baseball wanted a look at Rodriguez they sought out the highlight clips he would upload to his Instagram account. He hit .315/.404/.525 in the DSL, so there were plenty of those. His feed is also full of group photos with other young prospects and several big leaguers, all of whom Rodriguez is taller than. 
The convergence of his physical, technical, and seeming emotional maturity have caused Seattle to publicly consider skipping Rodriguez over the AZL and Northwest League in favor of sending him right to their new Low-A affiliate in Charleston, West Virginia as a young 18-year-old. The cultural assimilation curve may be steep, but Rodriguez is talented enough to have on-field success there. His approach is quiet and would appear contact-oriented if not for his prodigious natural strength, which turns would-be flare singles into gap doubles, and causes mis-hit flyouts to threaten the warning track. He could end up with a plus bat and plus power, plenty to profile in an outfield corner, hit in the middle of a good order, and perhaps be a perennial All-Star.

The pair signed for $6.25 million, $5.25 million of which went to 22-year-old Victor Victor. Mesa began playing in Cuba's Series Nacional when he was 16. He had a breakout '16-'17 at age 20 and swiped 40 bags while slashing .354/.399/.539. He was seen stateside the following summer during Cuba's tour of the CanAm League, but didn't play well. After he defected, teams' only looks at Mesa were in a workout setting. Cuban prospects have sometimes undergone drastic physical transformations between the point at which they’ve last been observed in Cuba and their workouts for teams. Sometimes these changes are positive, as with Luis Robert, who looked like an Ancient Greek sculpture when he worked out for teams in the Dominican Republic in 2017. Sometimes they are not; Yasiel Puig’s living conditions made it impossible for him to remain in baseball shape for his eventual workout in Mexico. But this was not the case with Mesa, who retained the sort of physicality he possessed during his last several years in Cuba. He ran a plus-plus 60-yard dash time, threw well, and hit some balls out to his pull side during batting practice. Mesa has a linear, contact-oriented swing that we think will lead to below-average power output in games. He can hit, defend, and add value on the bases, but there’s real doubt about the game application of his power. In aggregate, it looks like an average to slightly below-average offensive profile on an above-average defender at a premium position, which amounts to a low-risk, moderate impact prospect who should be ready for the big leagues relatively soon. He garners frequent comparisons to Cubs CF Albert Almora.","K7KQgt1ZsuU",

His defense was baptized by fire in the AZL as Naylor had to catch guys with huge stuff like Lenny Torres and Carlos Vargas, among others. If his offensive ability can withstand the developmental burdens and physical grind of catching, he could be a middle-of-the-order bat, too. Even if Naylor's in-game power manifests itself as doubles, he profiles at catcher and Cleveland's recent, brief experimentation with Francisco Mejia at third base provides some precedent for what may happen should Naylor prove unable to catch or if Cleveland thinks moving him will get his bat to the majors more quickly.","4SxNI1qCt10","sa3008247"

Wentz was 88-92 mph with solid average stuff and average command in 2018, and projects to improve when he has a full, healthy offseason to regain what he was the year before. He is also big and athletic with a smooth delivery and arm action, so there's the classic projection you're looking for.

At its best, Wentz's fastball was 92-95, hitting 96 mph, and his curveball and changeup were plus, with multi-innings stretches when his command looked above average, which led some scouts to invoke Cole Hamels.

And sometimes, they develop in the Goldilocks Zone, stay at short, and make a big offensive impact. That last outcome's existence, unlikely as it may be, puts prospects like Javier in a kind of rarified air, even when they haven't yet done anything, and Javier hasn't. 
When should we start to worry about all the injuries? Since signing in 2015, Javier has played in just 50 games while dealing with various maladies. He was in street clothes during part of 2015 instructs for reasons unknown to us, he played in just nine games in 2016 due to a hamstring strain, was healthy in 2017, then missed all of 2018 with a torn labrum in his non-throwing shoulder. This spring, he strained his quad and did not break camp with an affiliate. His frame has filled out and looked explosive, and during the spring, he was noticeably stronger and more powerful than he was when he signed.

The industry was surprised when the Giants immediately sent Fox, who was a tantalizing athlete but an undercooked ballplayer, to full-season ball. He didn't play well, and was traded to Tampa Bay for Matt Moore a few minutes ahead of the 2016 trade deadline. When the Rays performed a post-swap physical on Fox, they discovered a bone bruise in his foot that would end his season, a matter the two clubs settled after the Rays initially sought further compensation. Fox repeated Low-A the following year and started to perform some with the bat. He's hit for high averages wth no power each of the last two years, and had a strong 2018 Fall League. The lack of power might prevent Fox from being a true average or better regular, and he remains inconsistent on defense, but he's a top of the scale athlete whose late 2018 showing could be a sign of real growth.

He played at a high profile Atlanta-area high school (the same one as his brother Josh, who the Rays drafted in first round in 2016), played sparingly for a year at Mercer, then transferred to St. John's River junior college in Jacksonville, FL, where he hit 17 homers, a feat that got him to Mississippi State for his junior season. He had a solid season for the Bulldogs but was a first base-only prospect with no pedigree who hit five home runs, so you can see why he lasted until the 13th round in the 2016 draft.  His hitability translated well that first pro summer and in 2017, which he split across both A-Ball levels at ages 21 and 22. The missing element here is that while Lowe had plus raw power the first time we saw him at Mississippi State, he didn't have the kind of swing or approach to get the most out of it. This untapped tool and his plate discipline are the reasons he was a 13th rounder and not a 35th rounder who went back to school for his senior year. In 2018, Lowe did a rare thing: he tried to do more damage at the plate and lift the ball a bit more, but was able to keep his contact rates the same while adding game power. Miguel Andujar did this in the Yankees farm system two years in a row and went from an untapped, toolsy prospect who was passed over in the Rule 5 Draft to a Rookie of the Year runner-up; Lowe went from the top of the ""Others of Note"" section last year to one of the top 150 prospects in the game over a 12 month period. Lowe is a fine defender at first but the value here is all in the bat. Because he's left-handed, the downside is a platoon option at 1B/DH, though the Rays cycle through those types very quickly. Underlying indicators and TrackMan data suggest Lowe's very loud 2018 stats aren't fluky and he may just be a 50 bat with advanced feel for the zone and 60 game power, which is a solid regular.

Newton is much more of a physical marvel on which to dream than he is a polished performer. At a very projectable 6-foot-4, he's the size of an NFL wide receiver prospect and already has considerable raw power that projects to plus at maturity. It's rare for infielders this size to stay at shortstop, but Newton looks natural and comfortable there even though he clearly hasn't totally grown into his body yet and appears uncoordinated at other times. Even if he outgrows short, switch-hitting third basemen with power are extremely valuable. Newton has less bat control and feel to hit than his .280 batting average would otherwise indicate, and there's a chance he's always strikeout prone and doesn't get to some of his power.

Alzolay may have also had some health issues during his breakout 2017. He was given extended rest throughout July and August, his starts often spaced out by six days. He didn’t throw more than 80 pitches in any August start and was shut down late in that month, then asked to pick up innings in the Arizona Fall League. He has this system's best two-pitch mix, a fastball/power curveball combo that is ready for a major league bullpen as soon as Alzolay is healthy. To profile in a rotation, he will need a better changeup than the one he has shown in the past; missing several months of action with his lat issue likely slowed that process.

He holds 94-97 for six innings, his upper-80s slider with vertical break is reminiscent of early-career Brad Lidge, and he has somehow found changeup feel and command despite few career in-game reps. But while Loaisiga has mid-rotation, big league stuff, his career has been beset by constant, often severe, injury. Since entering pro ball in 2013, Loaisiga has only thrown about 200 career innings due to repeated injury and rehab, and his 68 innings pitched for the DSL Giants during his first pro campaign remain his single-season high. He missed all of 2014 with injury, then was released, and out of pro baseball for all of 2015. The Yankees unearthed him during the 2016 23U World Championships in Venezuela and after a frantic late-night call from scout Ricardo Finol, signed Loaisiga immediately. Just two innings into his first 2016 start, Loaisiga's velocity dropped into the mid-80s and he left the mound pointing at his elbow. He rehabbed quickly enough that he was able to make 11 short starts with Staten Island the following year. 
Because Loaisiga signed in 2012, he would have been Rule 5 eligible in the winter of 2017. The Yankees added him to the 40-man even though he had never completed a healthy start in full-season ball. In 2018, Loaisiga ascended quickly and showed flashes of brilliance against big league hitters, but he also made two more trips to the disabled list, including a late-season stint due to shoulder inflammation. Shoulder issues have sidelined Loaisiga pretty frequently during his career, and while he may have some years where he peaks in the 3-4 WAR range, we also think he'll have some years where he barely pitches, or that he may just move to the bullpen.","Gqzng3LiY6A","19753"

He was a slightly-built, shorter righty with a knockout fastball/curveball combination, who was moved very quickly as Garcia saw 2017 action in the DSL, GCL, and Appy league levels at age 18. We were eager to see if he could continue to perform like that in full-season ball as a 19-year-old and boy, did he. Garcia had an xFIP under 3.00 at each of his three stops last year: eight Low-A starts, five in Hi-A (one of which is the linked video), and one in Double-A. Garcia's changeup and command both ended up playing better than we expected, with his changeup regularly flashing average to above -- confirming he has starter's stuff -- and his command sufficient to deal with A-ball hitters. The concerns about his durability tied to his stature are still there. He's 5-foot-10 and anywhere from 163 to 175 pounds. He threw 74.0 innings last year and even scouts who love Garcia concede he may not be a 170 to 200-inning type of arm. Instead, he may be in the Rich Hill or Lance McCullers mold, where you'll get 125 - 135 innings and hopefully have him healthy enough to fill whatever role fits the staff best in the playoffs. Hill and McCullers are 55 or 60 FV types, so that's likely Garcia's upside if things break right. 
Garcia is a very good athlete, which is what allows him to repeat his delivery, throw so many strikes, and have at least average command despite a delivery that has crossfire, recoil, and effort at release. We're hesitant to knock Garcia's delivery simply because it's unusual, or due to his size, because his performance at this age has also been remarkable. He has a rising fastball with which he operates up in the zone, and he knows exactly how to use his high spin curveball, which has been over 3000 rpm at times. A well-located fastball up, a high-spin curveball down, and a changeup down to keep hitters honest is a good combo, and Garcia knows how to use them in sequence to set up hitters. There's some question about his approach being too simplistic to work at the big league level, but again, we would bet on Garcia figuring out how to make it work. He'll open 2019 in Double-A and could be good enough to crack the Bombers bullpen late in the season.","TtDspHp7TRI","sa916944"

He was one of the best performing amateur hitters from Venezuela in his signing class (just ahead of Everson Pereira, who's further down this list), and he was also a plus runner who could've been converted to catcher given his quickness, arm strength, and squatty, powerful frame. But the Yankees didn't want to slow down his bat by asking him to learn to catch. Some scouts who had a one or two game look at this summer didn't love Cabello's non-projectable frame, and they rounded down if he didn't hit in those short looks. But those who saw him for more than a few games saw the advanced bat amateur scouts saw. 
One enthusiastic scout described Cabello's running as plus, though he's not the typically graceful, long striding plus runner. That scout he said had a ""grinding gait, full effort, kicking up grass as he runs like the rooster tail of a speed boat."" In addition to potential plus hit and run tools, there's above-average arm strength and raw power, and now the start of a strong statistical performance record. And if things go askew at the plate, the notion that Cabello could catch is interesting.

His 13-start Northwest/Sally League tour, during which he walked just 19 in 54 innings, was the first step toward quelling concerns about his viability as a starter, though we're still somewhat apprehensive here at FanGraphs. 
Crouse's repertoire depth is not the issue. Based on his pitch usage during instructional league, his changeup seemed to be a developmental priority, and he has indeed made progress with it. It now comfortably projects to average, while Crouse's fastball/breaking ball combination has been excellent since he was a high school underclassman.  He incorporates all kinds of crafty veteran wrinkles into his delivery's cadence on occassion. An extra shoulder wiggle, a Travoltaian gyration of the hips, the occasional quick-pitch -- all sorts of things designed to take hitters by surprise. Scouts often sentence quirky, visibly fiery and emotional hurlers to late-inning duty, and we do think Crouse would thrive in such a role, but view these traits as positives. Crouse has a unique build and delivery, and is a very short strider whose 5-foot-4 extension sucks some of the perceived velo out of his fastball. This, plus the lower slot, might make him unusually vulnerable to lefties despite his velocity.

Ragans' curveball is not good, but there are several instances of pitchers having success with a playable fastball, elite changeup, and command of both, with Chris Paddack ascending for those reasons as we speak. Ragans projected as a No. 4 starter prior to the injury and is now just a little bit behind the developmental curve because of it.","9643WDWjlw0","sa917938"

After dealing with severe injury issues as an amateur -- he suffered from a strained UCL in high school and had a screw put in his elbow as a college freshman after suffering two humeral fractures -- as well as more minor maladies as a pro, Hearn was healthy for all of 2018 and threw more innings in a single season than at any point in his career. He struck out 140 hitters in 129 innings at Double-A. He remains a fairly spotty strike-thrower, but his three-pitch mix should enable him to continue to start, though probably as a 120 or 130-inning type rather than a true workhorse, which also makes sense considering Hearn's health history. He has rare lefty starter velocity and generally sits 93-96. A 95 mph average fastball would rank third among southpaw starters in baseball, just behind James Paxton and Blake Snell. Hearn can dump in his average curveball for strikes and his changeup has slowly turned into an average pitch, too. The cambio may yet have some developing to do as Hearn worked more heavily off his breaking ball early in his career and has lost a lot of reps due to injury. He profiles as a fastball-centric No. 4 or 5 starter for us, though there's a large subset of teams who think he ends up in the bullpen.","xBsQkoZ_9tw","18325"

He became the fallback option for clubs who were in pursuit of Shohei Ohtani, one of which was Texas, and he signed for $2.8 million in early-March of 2018. The timing of the deal, Martinez's age relative to other first-year prospects, and the lack of game action he had seen since defecting made his early-2018 developmental path tough to anticipate. The Rangers ended up starting him in the DSL (government processes and paperwork probably had something to do with that) and then skipped him over the AZL and sent him to the Northwest League for the final two months of the summer.  
His Fall League stint, though, was more telling. At that point, he had played enough to be sharp again, but not so much as to be gassed, and the opposing pitching in Arizona was an age-appropriate challenge while the NWL was arguably not. And Martinez's showing in the AFL was fine. He has all sorts of tricks for trying to reach base; he'll bunt for hits, he'll show bunt and then try to poke liners over the heads of approaching infielders, he'll occasionally walk toward the front of the batter's box during the pitcher's delivery and try to slash awkward contact somewhere while giving himself a head start down the line. Martinez's bat head drags into the zone a little bit and while he can adjust his lower half to alter the vertical placement of his barrel, he can also get tied up by velo inside. He projects as a middling offensive player with plus speed, and a capable defender in center. He may be a second division regular but is probably a platoon or fourth outfielder on a contending team.

Then word started to trickle out that the kid who had missed the summer and fall showcases with an ACL tear had turned into a completely different player, one who now had 70 bat speed. Early in the spring, videos of his first few majestic homers led to a rush of national crosscheckers and scouting directors getting in to see Beck, as most of them never had before. It's rare for a prep hitter to land in the first 10 picks with only one spring of looks and data, none of it on TrackMan, and almost none of it against pro-quality pitching, but Beck's tools were just that loud: 70 bat speed, easy plus raw power, plus speed, and a plus arm. 
It's similar to how Clint Frazier looked at the same stage, though Frazier had a long summer of production, faced strong prep competition, and still only went fifth overall. Beck's pro debut revealed some weaknesses that aren't evident against mediocre prep pitching and he was clearly overmatched in the AZL during his first pro summer and often visibly frustrated. He was 19 in Low-A last year and was able to hit for average, but very little power. Like Frazier, Beck has a good chance to lose a step as his body matures, and move to right field as a result, so pressure is on the bat. Pro scouts don't see the impact power that amateur scouts saw. We're cautiously optimistic that improved strength and swing work will tease out more game power during his age-20 season in the hitter-friendly Cal League.","oAS3Hzfb8Jc","sa3004055"

He remains one of the more physically gifted players not only in this system, but in all of the minor leagues. He is a no-doubt 80 runner who circled the bases during an inside-the-park home run in the Dominican this winter in just 14.40 seconds. That's approaching Byron Buxton territory even though Mateo paused on his way to first and slowed up as he approached and needlessly slid in to home. He also has above-average raw power that he has never manifested in games due to a variety of issues that make it unlikely he ever will. His lower half usage in the box is sub-optimal, he too often expands the zone, and he frequently settles for middling, opposite-field contact. 
These have been Mateo's issues for over seven years now, and with each passing season, they're less and less likely to improve. But because Mateo has such prodigious athletic gifts and is going to play somewhere up the middle (he has the physical tools for shortstop and has looked fine there in big league trials this spring, but remains procedurally immature), he's likely to force his way on the field somehow, and he has a better chance of making a big league impact than everyone below him on this list.

The Jays rave about Smith's makeup and preparation, and how he spearheaded the adjustments to his swing to have a shorter path to the ball and increase his contact ability. He now has a flatter-planed swing, and one scout compared his offense to Jordy Mercer, while another thinks Smith is a 50 hitter with 50 game power. Most scouts think he's fringy at shortstop despite a plus arm, and would shift him to second base long-term for the best fit, where he's got a chance to be above average. An 85 to 100 wRC+ with solid average defense at second base is worth 2-something WAR, so while it isn't sexy, there's some performance here, real changes to explain it, and a pretty good chance to be a 50 or 55 FV big leaguer.","JrOhd9zqQB0","sa915864"

Pardinho grew up in Brazil, which has a large Japanese population, and he has some Japanese heritage; his windup clearly points to a Japanese influence. 
The issue here is that Pardinho is listed at 5-foot-10 and 155 pounds, and isn't much bigger than that right now, though he has a sturdy build. 18-year-old pitchers need to have big velocity, or projection to add velocity, to be top prospects since they generally start losing velocity in their mid-20s; that innate velocity, or projection for it, offers some margin for error. There are exceptions to this benchmark, like Zack Greinke, cases where a pitcher has been a pitchability type with above average stuff from his teenage days all the way into a big league career, but those instances are very rare. Pardinho will sit 92-95 and hit 96 mph early in outing and settle around 90-93 later. His curveball flashed above average as an amateur and he mixed in a slider that lagged behind, but those two pitches are both average to above now. They're different pitches but still can run together at times, common for a younger pitcher. Parindho's changeup is his fourth pitch now and it's around average, but he separated himself with above average command projection, which helped him post gaudy numbers in his pro debut in the Appalachian League at 17. 
Pardinho is undoubtedly advanced and projects as a No. 3 or 4 starter if things go well, but he was essentially pitching like a college senior in a league where a college senior can dominate and then never get to Double-A. Pardinho is a prospect because he's advanced enough to pitch like a 22-year-old when he's 17 years old. We'd just like to see either his stuff improve -- or hold that velocity for the whole game -- or see performance against more advanced hitters before we shoot him up the list like he's the next Greinke.","mkTCI4QKkSM","sa968102"

Stewart will most certainly give back some value on defense as he's not a good defensive outfielder and probably belongs at DH. The predicament in Detroit is that so too do many of their other hitters, even though Victor Martinez has retired.

If there's suddenly more lift here then Castro could be a top 100 prospect by mid year. He's going to stay at short (plus range, average hands, above-average arm) but the average big league shortstop had a 95 wRC+ last year and Castro is a very aggressive hitter likely to run below-average OBPs.

It's rare that a high school hitter from Chicago is this polished, especially one as young as Thomas, who was barely 18 on draft day. 
He runs well enough to project in center field (though his reads from the corners are much better right now and he might just be a plus corner glove, also like Gardner), which makes the unenthusiastic, frame-based power projection less concerning. There's some tweener fourth outfielder risk here because of the lack of power projection and potential move off of center field, but it's reasonable to hope some combination of contact, on base ability and defense make up for that and enable Thomas to be a regular.","Bo9Wh47-Wm4","sa3006892"

Then he blew out about halfway through his sophomore year, requiring Tommy John surgery. He missed all of 2017, then came back for an age-22 redshirt junior year and appeared to be all the way recovered, which lead to the Nationals taking him in the second round. Early in his career, Crowe looked to be on the same trajectory as Joba Chamberlain (who also slipped in the draft due to elbow and knee concerns), which would mean ending up in the bullpen while throwing in the high-90's with a power breaking ball. Post surgery, he's a little more starter-looking than that, working 91-94 and hitting 95 mph, with a changeup that has emerged as his best offspeed pitch, and a high-spin curveball and slider that both are average to above.

The 38 innings he threw at Low-A to round out 2018 were dominant, as Abreu recorded 68 strikeouts, most of which were accrued with either of his two excellent breaking balls, which he has better feel for locating than he does his mid-90s fastball. 
There's considerable industry doubt regarding Abreu's ability to start, the result of several factors. The lack of total innings creates reasonable doubt about him handling a 140-plus inning workload, and the lack of fastball command, along with Abreu's mediocre changeup, are also cited as pitfalls. As long as Abreu's breaking ball command refines though, he may have the tools to attack lefties and get ahead of hitters even if these other components are sub-optimal. His 40-man addition makes it more likely that he spends the early part of his big league career in the bullpen, but he may be a dominant multi-inning piece and could evetually transition into the rotation.

So judicious is Rengifo's eye for the plate that if he were cloned 15 times and each clone forced to be an umpire, there might be a lot less talk of electronic strike zones. He identifies balls and strikes early in flight and often relaxes before balls have even entered the catcher's mitt. There's a chance that Rengifo's lack of power (he has more from the right side) limits the way his eye for the zone plays in the big leagues, since pitchers will be more likely to attack him without fear of him doing damage on his own. Most of his doubles come by slashing balls down either baseline, or when he turns gappers into extra bases because of his speed. We think there's enough bat to retain most of the on-base ability Rengifo has shown so far and that, combined with his multi-positional versatility, could yield super-utility value. 
Though he spent all of last year playing either second base or shortstop, Rengifo also has experience in both outfield corners and at third base. The Angels added Rengifo to the 40-man this offseason and while they're well-stocked on the infield (Simmons, La Stella, Fletcher, Cozart), they're rather thin in the outfield, and very right-handed.

Collecting stats from summer showcase events, or even spring games when prep hitters face pro-quality pitching, is one way to pinpoint how advanced a prospect is beyond a pure scouting report, and is something almost no clubs did systematically until the last half dozen years or so. Jackson is a perfect example of the limitations of this practice. 
He stood out on the showcase circuit with an infielder's footwork and actions (though his hands were inconsistent) and potentially above-average offense. But Jackson's performance was generally below average in this setting and he struck out a lot, so he was shifted into the fourth to fifth round area that often sends this sort of player to college. In the spring, Jackson was going off against poor competition in South Alabama and we were hesitant to shift his grade on that basis until we were told that he got glasses to correct some vision issues that had contributed to his summer disappointment. Now, his spring performance could still end up meaning little, but there was a shot he was a new prospect, and we never got a pre-draft opportunity to see him against good pitching. With that optimism in mind, we ranked him 31st in the 2018 draft class but the Angels were able to get him at 57th overall, as many clubs now run their draft off of models that lean heavily on summer performance when there's bulk and Jackson was at almost every event.
Jackson hit seven homers with above average production across the board in 43 pro games after signing, and it's looking like he may have been underrated by a purely numbers-based approach to the draft. We see a potential 50 or 55 on every tool and at least a third base fit in pro ball, if not a chance to play middle infield, which translates to a strong regular.","cy7v3sfh_sU","sa3007740"

Adolfo's early career was mired in strikeouts and injury. He struck out at a 43% clip in his first season, missed most of 2015 due to a gruesome leg fracture, and then broke his hamate a month into 2016 and hit for no power after he returned. 
While he continues to strike out at a somewhat troubling rate (30% combined over the last two seasons), Adolfo has performed each of the last two years despite playing through an elbow injury that required Tommy John in 2018. He's grown into the power expected of him as an amateur and has slugged just shy of .460 as an age-appropriate regular at Low- and Hi-A. Back from Tommy John during the Spring of 2019, Adolfo looked buff, but stiff. The power is still there, but so too is the risk he ends up as a DH.

He had a strong track record of performance in high school, but concerns about his power projection arose during Rutherford's first full season, when he slugged just .348. One could point to his age (Rutherford was as old as a junior college prospect on draft day) as an indicator that should have been tempered our expectations of his power growth in the first place. But really, Rutherford's swing, while picturesque, is just geared for all-fields doubles. He has some low-ball, home run power to his pull side, but otherwise does damage peppering the gaps and third baseline. Half of his 2018 doubles were struck to left of center field.

Like Rutherford ahead of him, it's tough to project corner outfielders with middling power as average or better regulars.

The injury washed away the rest of 2016 and essentially all of 2017, as a visibly hobbled Lewis stopped and started baseball activity several times due to ongoing issues with the knee. He even began 2018 with a month-long stay on the injured list because he wasn't a full go when spring training began. He was healthy for the rest of 2018 but his performance was mixed, and his tools beneath where they were in college. He was clearly less explosive than most of his peers at the Futures Game were, but of course at that point he had only been playing healthy, regular baseball for about two months. 
This spring, the physical ability that had scouts calling Lewis the most talented prospect on Cape Cod -- and that drove him to near the top of 2016 draft boards -- has returned. That injured right knee looks healthy as it twists and bends through contact. It's shouldering more of a mechanical burden now than it was in 2017, certainly, and Lewis is taking healthy but comfortable hacks with the same natural flyball loft he exhibited in college. He's hit a few impressive spring training homers but has also swung through quite a few fastballs in the zone, some in the 90-92 mph range. Teams were concerned about potential strikeout issues in college, concerns that were exacerbated by the small-school competition he faced, which served to limit the confidence teams had in his performance. This year is not only important for Lewis' development but for the industry's understanding of his profile.

His early career strikeout rate (7.5% in about 450 PA) suggests his bat-to-ball skills are even more promising than amateur scouts anticipated, though he's also an aggressive swinger who has been hit by nearly twice as many pitches as he has walks so far.

In anticipation of a short-term need for outfielders, Cleveland traded teenage beast Jhon Torres for Mercado, a low-ceiling lock to contribute to the big league team at some point soon. 
Once a prep infield prospect, Mercado moved to the outfield after a few uninspiring statistical years with St. Louis, started to hit, became a plus outfield defender, and was part of a log jammed upper-level Cardinals outfield picture.

He's likely on a path similar to Corbin Burnes and Freddy Peralta, where he'll initially debut as a multi-inning reliever, but a fine three-pitch mix means Brown could eventually transition into a starting role, profiling as a #4/5.

Some of the pre-draft notions that Pratto had elite plate discipline (part of why he generated some irresponsible Joey Votto comps at the time) seem false now that we have a larger sample of data to look at.

Still, corner-only hitters with approach issues -- Hays is a free swinger with a pull-heavy approach -- run the risk of having their lack of discernment taken advantage of in the majors with little defensive value left to fall back on. After reaching Baltimore in 2017, 2018 was a nightmare for Hays: he struggled out of the gate, had his approach tinkered with to try to fix things only to have it not work, then injured his ankle and needed surgery. He missed two months and continued struggling when he returned. Some rival clubs see a buy-low opportunity and would love to take a chance on Hays' tools, but the Orioles probably aren't selling low, with the rebuilding club offering an easy road to MLB playing time for the foreseeable future. There's big offensive talent here if Hays can bounce back and find an approach that works in the big leagues.

Sources indicated to us that had he not hit his innings limit late in 2018, he would've gotten a big league look in September. The condition of Baltimore's pitching staff is certainly favorable for a soonish Akin debut, and he'll likely open 2019 in Triple-A. 
He has above-average big league stuff, especially for a lefty: he sits 92-95 and hits 98 mph, mixing in a solid average slider and a plus changeup. His command ranges from 40 to 60 depending on the start, and Akin's build often leads scouts to believe this is due to his conditioning. We're wary of discounting a player just because he doesn't fit traditional rubrics for success, and baseball is littered with unusual frames and mechanics, but Akin has also had hamstring and oblique issues. The stuff is of the No. 4 to No. 4/5 starter range, but there's also a chance Akin ends up in the bullpen.

Offensively, McKenna's abilities fall somewhere between that incredible first half and his lousy late-summer showing at Double-A Bowie.

At first blush, he's an unimpressive athlete who sits around 90 mph with his fastball, and throws from a lower slot that makes you wonder if he's an obvious reliever. Sure, the curveball flashes plus and you've noticed he commands all of his pitches, which might enable an average changeup to be a successful third weapon. As you dig a little deeper, you notice that Lowther hides his arm behind his body for much of his delivery and that he has nearly seven feet of down-mound extension, which screws with hitters' feel for timing his fastball and helps it play up. 
Most scouts don't like pitchers who work up in the strike zone, but there is a specific type who can make this work and we think Lowther is exactly that type. The formula is to get down the mound, throw from a lower release point, and have a fastball that ""rises'"" -- that's rare to create from a low slot -- and command it to parts of the zone where hitters are vulnerable; Lowther does all of these things. He has below-average velocity, but we think the fastball is a 55 pitch with these separators, and some scouts think his changeup plays up for the same reason. With all that in mind, you see Lowther in a different light: as a durable innings-eating starter with a long track record of success, three 55-to-60 grade pitches and command, along with the pitchability and deception qualities that help ensure he'll still stick in a rotation if his raw stuff takes a step backward. Lowther turns 23 in April and likely starts the season in Double-A, but he may be one of the top five starters in the Orioles organization by midseason. He's about as low risk of a pitching prospect as you'll see among those who haven't been above A-ball.

During his first few pro seasons, Duran's velocity yo-yo'd a bit; he was at times in the upper-90s, while more 91-95 at others. He was also demoted from the Northwest League back to the AZL in 2017 for reasons seemingly unrelated to performance. The following spring, not only was Duran's velocity more stable -- in the 93-96 range -- but he was throwing strikes and had more consistent secondary stuff. 
While he can spin a good breaking ball, Duran's best secondary pitch is his changeup, which he sells with electric arm speed. He worked with better angle after the Twins acquired him last summer, a change that improved the playability of his breaking ball without taking away from his changeup's movement. Now a physically mature, 230-pound 21-year-old, Duran seems poised to take a bit of a leap and perhaps reach the Florida State League later in the year. He may end up with three impact pitches if his secondaries have yet another gear of quality left to claim, which makes him a threat for the top 100 list either later this year or next.","nj13l4r6Qug","sa873347"

Moving up a year made him age-appropriate for a high schooler in their draft year; at 18.4, he was basically average for a prep player. With that early-career acclaim came a change in the way opposing pitchers approached Casas. They began to pitch around him, and scouts often left Casas games having seen him swing just once or twice because he was constantly walking. Luckily Casas had a long track record of hitting in games, had participated in multiple home run derbies during his amateur summers, and posted gaudy exit velocities during team pre-draft workouts, so clubs knew what his offensive potential was. He has good hands and a plus arm that helped him pitch into the low-90's on the mound, but is a well-below average runner with poor lateral mobility. He played third base after signing (mostly during instructs though, as Casas injured his thumb sliding for a ground ball in June, needed surgery, and barely played during the summer) but expectations are he'll move across the diamond to first base in 2019 or 2020, where we think he'll be quite good. Casas' calling card is his bat and there's potential for a 60 hit, 70 game power, 80 raw power kind of package.

He was getting pegged as a non-impact type, the sort of backup second baseman the likes of which teams don't carry anymore; his best ability (pitch selection) wasn't even a tool, and it didn't matter much if he didn't have any power. Most of that changed in 2018 as the Rays' strategy of drafting players projected as second baseman and seeing if they can play shortstop worked out, with Clay Davenport's defensive metrics grading Walls at +16 runs over 103 games, about as high of a number as you'll see in the minor leagues. Scouts tended to agree that Walls was above average at the position, more due to angles and instincts than raw tools, and this development seemed to surprise even the Rays. Offensively, Walls started driving the ball more and doing some extra base damage when he was getting into good counts. The raw tools are still mostly average and he was 22 years old in Low-A, a function of the Rays' middle infield depth blocking a deserved promotion, so there isn't amazing upside here.

He had another velo bump early in his college career, which eventually led to Tommy John surgery. Buzz grew in scouting circles as his post-surgery stuff was elite and after his first start of 2018, a heavily-scouted matchup with North Carolina, McClanahan looked like a top five overall pick. In that game, he hit 100 mph and flashed an above average slider and changeup along with enough feel to project as a starter. From then on, things started to unravel, until the Rays popped the local kid 31st overall. McClanahan had some minor issues -- a finger injury and fluctuating velo as weather and workload dictated -- but more worrisome to scouts were both his maturity and how he fared when his fastball was more of a 6 than an 8, and his command was a 3 or 4 instead of a 5. Most college pitchers can succeed with 55 or 60 stuff and below average command, but McClanahan struggled and showed it on the mound. The optimistic case is that a change of scenery, coaching, and workload (with less pressure) will help tease out that top five overall pick version of McClanahan, while the pessimistic case is that what we saw down the stretch is indicative of a future as a streaky power reliever with limited feel.","ntk-CU1Bo6A","sa3008547"

He doesn't have high spin rates on his breaking stuff and pitches more to weak contact, looking like a steady, durable, roughly league-average starter even as a college player.

Career-long issues with strike-throwing, coupled with two consecutive years of multiple DL stints, continue to funnel Abreu toward a bullpen role, despite the depth of his repertoire. The appendicitis set back Abreu's spring preparation and he was DL'd for most of April while he caught up.

As the summer wore on, Seigler grew on scouts, was chosen as the backup catcher for Team USA, and quickly took the starting job from eventual Marlins second rounder Will Banfield. Seigler was able to do this (and eventually become a first round pick) due to his innate present feel for contact at the plate and receiving behind it. In addition to solid contact skills, Seigler also started to lift the ball in games closer to the draft and get to all of his fringy raw power. This polish helped to make teams less worried about his advanced age relative to his prep peers, and some scouts thought he was among the top 5-10 players in the entire draft. 
Seigler had a solid pro debut that was in line with the expectations of any of the pro scouts we talked to who watched the Yankees' GCL club. He's an average runner and an above-average athlete for the position, projecting as an above-average defender with a 65-grade arm. Some clubs don't like the recent track record of prep catchers and considered taking Seigler and then moving him to third base, but his feel for catching is too advanced to throw away. There are some similarities to another prep catcher from the prior draft: M.J. Melendez of the Royals. Melendez is a little twitchier while Seigler is a little more advanced in terms of skills.

The pure stuff hasn't change and it's top of the line: a 95-97 mph heater that has hit 101 mph, a power curveball that's anywhere from 60 to 70 depending on the day, and a changeup that flashes 55 or 60 at its best. His command is now a 30 that we project to be a 40. But he's still a teenager, so there's a chance that things click for him and he finds 45 command and 50 control, which would be the minimum to stick as a starter with this kind of stuff. Medina's issues aren't physical -- his delivery is fine and his arm stroke is clean. Instead, the problem appears to be mostly mental. He'll throw well in the bullpen, only to have things will snowball for him in game situations. One source described his issues as stemming from a need for greater mental maturity and to not be so hard on himself, which are exactly the kinds of traits that come with general social maturity. That said, this sort of stuff rarely comes with starter command, so Medina is probably either a high-wire act reliever with bonkers stuff or a starter with the stuff ratcheted down a bit, similar to what Touki Toussaint has done the last couple seasons.","CULpv2BOf-0","sa928510"

Others think Allen is serviceable, and would gladly give up what he lacks on defense for what he'd provide at the catching position on offense: huge power, rare for the position. 
Allen elevates the ball with authority and has been doing so since college. He slugged .728 as a junior (while facing questions about competition quality in addition to the defensive stuff) and he has 50 or more extra base hits in each of the last two seasons. It's All-Star offensive ability for a catcher, it's just that most of the industry doesn't like him at the position. Perhaps what San Diego has done with Francisco Mejia (let him catch pitchers he can handle) will serve as precedent for what they may try with Allen, whose issues are admittedly different than Mejia's. They could let Allen catch pitchers who are adept at holding runners on their own, give him a start at first now and then, and let him take high-leverage at-bats off the bench against righties the rest of the time.

Seise has power and he'll occasionally show it to the opposite field in games, though his feel to hit is generally a little raw. 
He's a plus runner underway, but it takes him a few strides to really get going, and that lack of first-step quickness is also why some teams think he'll move off short, though players like this are more frequently staying there. Assuming it's fine returning from the surgery, Seise has the arm for anywhere on the infield. Staying at short takes some pressure off of what might be a suspect contact profile, as the power gives Seise a great chance of playing there everyday even if he whiffs a lot. Of course, if all of his issues are remedied then the ceiling is enormous, but until there's evidence of that, Seise is a risky tools/frame bet coming off a serious injury.","bB9NGkEjufw","sa3004142"

The likelihood of this is bolstered by the polished nature of Apostel's bat. His feel for the strike zone and his timing are both impressive for his age, and he is adept at attacking early-count pitches he can drive, while taking tough strikes. It helps him run deep counts and walk as well as hit for power. These traits are conducive to quick development, which means Apostel has a better chance of reaching the majors while he's still limber enough to play third for much of his first six big league seasons.

Moss is the most impressive athlete of the three, a compact little bundle of lightning with surprising power from both sides of the plate, and a good chance of playing defense up the middle somewhere, largely due to his speed. 
Though both of Moss' swings are fairly inconsistent (which should be expected for a switch-hitter this age), he'll show you feel for both lift and contact at times, and he gets the most out of his little body without losing control of it. While there's a large developmental gap between where Moss is as a defender right now and where he'll need to be in order to stay on the infield, he's a very athletic, very young player with tons of time to improve those things, and his physical gifts are so prominent that we anticipate he will. Up the middle switch-hitters with some pop, even if it's just doubles power, are very valuable big leaguers, and not many prospects have a chance to become that kind of player. So while we acknowledge that Moss is very risky (he struck out 30% of the time in the DSL and any number of issues might befall him during his half-decade long trudge to the big leagues) there just aren't many players in this system with that kind of ceiling.","JL9e7YVE21I","sa3005599"

Burke's fastball plays up because he gets way down the mound and generates a lot of backspin on the ball, creating perceived rise. Changeup development seemed to occur in 2018, as the pitch was much different last year (82-85 mph, at times with cut) than it was in 2017 (78-80 mph), and it’s fair to speculate that something like a grip change took place here. Burke has two breaking balls that are both about average, though he uses the curveball pretty sparingly. Glove-side command of his cutter/slider makes him tough on righties.

The 20-year-old was given an assignment that matched his loud tools (teams who saw him work out were putting 6's and 7's on his speed, arm, and defense at short) but not his readiness, and he was bad early in the year at Low-A Dayton. He came on, statistically, at the end of the year, but didn't walk much in either phase. Latin American players who have spent their entire lives playing ball back home, or in Florida or Arizona, sometimes struggle with the early-April chill of the Midwest League when they're first assigned there; as if being 20 in a full-season league after not playing for over a year wasn't enough, Garcia may have struggled with this. 2019 should be a more representative sample statistically of what Garcia is. There's no question about his run, field or throw tools, and he was seen at a bat-first prospect early in his Cuban career, so that might be in there, too.

Once that situation resolved, Armenteros signed for $3 million, then came stateside and looked concerningly raw, but clearly talented. His timing and breaking ball recognition were especially poor, but he hadn't seen live pitching for a long time, meaning it could have been due to rust. As the spring and summer of 2017 wore on, he started to develop a much better feel at the plate and by the fall of 2017, was hitting lasers to all fields off of curated instructional-league pitching. 
The Athletics pushed him to Low-A as a 19-year-old in 2018 and Armenteros posted a serviceable .277/.374/.401 line while striking out at a disquieting 34% clip.

He wrapped his 2017 season with short, statistically insignificant stints in Hi-A, Double-A, and the Arizona Fall League, but he performed at each stop, so combined there was confidence that Neuse's early-season showing was for real despite his relatively advanced age. 
He was sent right to Triple-A to start 2018 and flopped, hitting just .263/.304/.357 and striking out a concerning 32% of the time. Neuse has also thickened a bit, so while he's still an arm-reliant fit at third, he's trending more toward 3B/1B, and maybe right, than the SS/3B looks Washington gave him early in his career. The combination of the 2018 struggles and somewhat shaky standing on the defensive spectrum makes it imperative that Neuse have a bounce back 2019 performance. He's a baseball rat and younger than similarly-skilled players we've written up so far (like Mets third baseman J.D. Davis), so we're a little more bullish on a rebound here than we are elsewhere.

He was often seen by high-level decision makers during that breakout because he was playing alongside first round third baseman Jake Burger, and he had 2018 first round buzz by the end of the college postseason because scouts thought he could be a passable shortstop with all-fields power, and analytics folks liked his huge sophomore season and higher-than-you'd-expect exit velos. 
Then Eierman had an inconsistent summer with Team USA and his draft spring was a bit of a letdown. He plateaued, arguably had a worse statistical season, and suddenly there were doubts about his approach and ultimate defensive home. He fell to Oakland at 70th overall last summer. Oakland has been a bit more open to non-traditional fits at shortstop recently and they clearly think that with more reps there, Eierman can stick. He may be a 45 hitter who gets to his raw power in games and passes at short, along the lines of currently projected mid-first-round 2019 draft prospect Logan Davidson at Clemson.

Some thought he just needed more time to get back to full strength and speed, while others were scared off by their post-injury looks, which were so bad that multiple scouts told us they thought he may have been better off sitting out rather than giving teams a bad look just before the draft. 
At his best, McCarthy shows at least average raw power, plus speed, some feel to hit, and is a center field fit. His swing is naturally geared for opposite field contact, which will likely cap his power output unless he undergoes a swing change. That will be less necessary if McCarthy stays in center field.

It’s weird, but it works, and Santana looks like he’s going to be a plus hitter who also has a discerning eye for the strike zone, and whose plate crowding gets him hit by pitches so often that it actually matters. He has been hit in 4% of his 611 career plate appearances, which is nearly twice the career rate of active big league HBP leader Shin-Soo Choo (132 HBP, 1.9%) who became the active leader when Chase Utley (204 HBP, 2.5%) retired.
Athletically, Santana fits at second and third base. His body is pretty maxed out and he’s not likely to grow into sizable raw power, but he runs well, has infield-worthy hands, and an average arm.

In retrospect that looks a little silly, as the 2015 class included Vladimir Guerrero, Jr., Juan Soto, Fernando Tatis, Jr., Cristian Pache, and Andres Gimenez, but that opinion was the consensus amongst many top evaluators; those five superior prospects all received lower bonuses than Maitan for a reason. 
Maitan signed with Atlanta as the clear top prospect in his class, and the clear top prospect to emerge in many years. Then things took a turn for him as a pro. Maitan added some natural strength and bulk soon after signing (which many scouts anticipated, projecting him to a corner), then started adding some bad weight, lost his swing mechanics, and started tinkering. Things snowballed from there, ending in a disappointing debut season with Atlanta. After that season, the Braves international scandal hit, and Maitan became a free agent. He kept his original $4.25 million bonus (widely reported to have been topped by multiple clubs late in the process, though he and his family chose to honor their word to Atlanta) and hit the open market, where he received $2.2 million amid some scouts' suggestions that he wasn't even the best of the Braves' prospects to be cut loose. 
The same issues continued with Los Angeles in 2018, and Maitan had another disappointing season, with a worrisome physique and an evolving swing. The raw tools that originally got scouts interested -- raw power you can project to a 70, a 65-grade arm, infield hands, feel to hit -- still appear to be in there and Angels sources indicate Maitan spent the offseason getting in better shape, a process they anticipated would be slow from the onset, hopefully foreshadowing a breakout year.

For our purposes, Astudillo forces us to consider how we define the hit tool without letting other skills bleed in, which leads us to all kinds of existential questions about traditional tool classifications. Eventually, your tools just are what your performance is, and Astudillo has accumulated about a month's worth of freakish data that's impossible to ignore. He has been, and this is true of his entire pro career, an elite K% (3%) and in-zone contact rate (96%) hitter, and were we to make a hierarchy of individual stats that indicate ability to hit, those would be at the top. 
This thinking can be considered flawed. Jose Iglesias has had plus-plus contact rates throughout his career, but hits just .265 because he lacks strength. That's a lack of power bleeding in to how the hit tool plays, but in his case we'd say the hit tool is still good. You could argue that, similar to power, we should have Raw Hit and Game Hit split into two tools. In that vein, Astudillo is again exemplary in the way his tools/skills interact, as his game power plays beneath his raw, because he can't help himself but swing so damn much, and often the contact is sub-optimal. The Fat Ichiro moniker was bestowed upon Brett Wallace too soon; this is the genuine article. 
Correctly dubbed ""positionless"" as a young prospect, Astudillo has ended up a passable glove at several of the places minor league managers tried to hide him in his early 20s. Minnesota has played him all over the field -- catcher, first base, second base, third base, left field -- and he's okay everywhere. He had average catcher pop times in the big leagues last year.

The type of contact Arraez makes is unique. He employs a punchy, minimalist swing, and just kind of throws the bat head at the baseball, leading to lots of opposite field contact. It's worked so far, and Arraez has hit for enough contact to outweigh the total lack of game power that results from this kind of approach. It's unlikely that this is an Altuven situation where all of a sudden there's power, because Altuve was pulling the ball in the minors. 
Mostly because his actions are quite good, Arraez fits fine at second base. He's a thicker guy and has begun to see more time at other positions (mostly other infield spots), and versatility will enable a team to roster Arraez even if the lack of power turns out to be a problem.

Mike Olt, Juan Francisco, Matt Davidson, and Pedro Alvarez are recent examples of players with offensive skills who struggled to overcome their issues with strikeouts. But Dalbec is also more athletic than most of those low-contact, corner sluggers, and looked great at third base during the Fall League. Realistically, Dalbec's issues limit him to a bench or platoon role, largely enabled by his ability to play third base well. But because there's superlative power here, the ceiling is sky high if things suddenly click with the bat. Dalbec also spent time pitching in college (he was 91-93 with an average slider), a secondary skill that is of increasing interest to teams, though it's still just largely considered to be a parlor trick to show off during a blowout.","oP7cYGSzG4M","sa857701"

He had a silky smooth delivery and projectable frame, with average big league stuff almost two years before he was even eligible to be drafted. His stuff just ticked up from there and arguably peaked the summer before his draft year, when Groome would work 92-96 mph in short stints, worked with an easy plus curveball, mixed in an average to above changeup, and did it with that big, athletic frame and starter's delivery, all of which led to being a first overall pick favorite at the time. But a myriad of concerns unrelated to Groome's talent dogged him more than most prep prospects. That, combined with a quickly thickening frame, contributed to his fall out of the top 10 picks of the 2016 draft. Since signing, Groome hasn't been on the mound much, making just 17 total pro starts due to a back injury and, eventually, Tommy John surgery. He's slated to return to the mound in June or July of 2019. Some scouts are still wary of his high school off-field issues and maxed-out frame, seeing a bunch of 50 or 55 attributes aside from his plus curveball. Those who are still on board not that his changeup was improving and his velo was regularly up to 96 mph prior to surgery, leading them to think that he was just getting back on track.

He's been throwing bullpens and is on track to return sometime in the middle of 2019. It's unclear if the drop in velocity De Leon exhibited betwixt his DL stints was due to injury or if that's just how hard he throws now. At his prospect peak in Los Angeles, when De Leon struck out no fewer than 32% of opposing hitters over a three-season stretch, he was sitting 92-94, and touching 96. Though there's less stigma surrounding drop-and-drive deliveries now, there was concern about De Leon's fastball being liftable even at that velocity due to it's plane. At his more recent 89-91, it's more worrisome. But if the velocity comes back, De Leon will have two plus pitches in his fastball and a goofy changeup, which has weird, horizontal action. He throws a ton of strikes and has two viable breaking balls. He could be a No. 3 or 4 starter if everything comes back, but is more like a No. 5 if it doesn't.

Dodson was Cal's two-hole hitter, starting center fielder, and closer. If forced to chose a traditional developmental path, teams would have overwhelmingly preferred Dodson on the mound, where his stuff is commensurate with a typical middle reliever. But Dodson is also a plus-running switch-hitter, with some natural lift as a right-handed hitter and good barrel control as a lefty. The Rays want to take advantage of all of Dodson's skills and asked that he be announced on draft day as a two-way player. At Cal, Dodson would often warm up his arm in center field, sometimes very little, before coming in to pitch in save situations. In pro ball, he pitched once every seven days, would have a bullpen day at the midpoint between outings, and either DH or play CF on the other days. Developing as a two-way player is actually less labor intensive than existing as one in college, where Dodson's schedule was more variable. Neither of Dodson's individual roles projects to be one of impact. On the mound he looks like a middle reliever; with the bat he looks like a fourth outfielder.

King had been a Marlins 12th round pick out of Boston College a year and a half prior to the deal and, like clockwork, had only struck out about six batters per nine innings every year in college, as well as in his first two pro seasons. The Marlins altered King's position on the rubber and made other mechanical tweaks to alter the movement profile of his pitches. After the Yankees acquired him, they let him return to what he was doing in college and he vastly exceeded even the most optimistic expectations in 2018. He led the Yankees system in strikeouts and innings while traversing three levels, reaching Triple-A. 
The lynchpin of King's success is his command of a dancing two-seam fastball that runs back onto his glove-side corner of the plate. Left-handed hitters think it's coming at their hip, righties give up on it because they think it's off the plate, and King gets a lot of looking strikeouts with it. There are questions about the quality of his secondary stuff. He has a quality changeup, but his breaking ball is mediocre.

He seemed a mess, a potential DFA candidate. 
This spring, Guerra has moved to the mound. His first bullpen session, which took place in front of a very small contingent of Padres front office folks, was electric. The first fastball was clocked by Rapsodo at 97 mph, and a few fastballs later, Guerra touched 100.4 mph. He has been working, an inning at a time, twice a week in Extended Spring Training. Eric saw him shortly before publication, and he was 95-98 with natural cut at times (in the linked video you can see how his fastball's spin axis is somewhat slidery) and had pretty impressive slider feel for someone who has only been pitching for a few weeks.

Then German (Dominican-born and whose name is pronounced like the European country) had one of the latest pre-draft velo spikes possible, suddenly hitting 95 mph during the Atlantic Sun conference tournament in his final college game just two weeks before the draft. Velo is a dime a dozen these days, but German had the athleticism and arm action of a starter and had put on about 15 pounds in the previous 12 months, so some thought this could be coming. Clubs who had scouts at that start shot him up the board, and the Yankees jumped to the front of the line to take him in the fourth round. The velo spike held in pro ball: German sat 92-95 and hit 97 mph in fall instructional league and put on about 10 additional pounds after signing. The upside is a bit limited, as his slider and changeup still just flash average at best, but the Yankees are changing German's slurvy college breaking ball into more of a true slider and pushing him to throw his changeup more, so it wouldn't be shocking to see the future pitch grades move north as he continues to mature as a pitcher.",,"sa3007729"

The drop in his ground ball rate since coming over from LA -- 38% with Texas, after close to 50% with the Dodgers -- seems to corroborate the visual evidence of tweaks, so there's a chance Davis' 2018 was just the product of developmental growing pains. 
Even at 21, Davis remains physically projectable and is likely to add more and more mass and strength to his giant frame as he enters his mid-20s.

Let's go over the injury history: Kap missed nearly all of 2016 due to a flexor-tendon strain, but his stuff was great when he returned for the 2016 Fall League. He blew out his UCL during 2017 spring training and needed Tommy John. In Eric's looks at Kaprielian as he rehabbed back from TJ during extended spring of 2018, he was 91-94 instead of 94-97, then was shut back down with shoulder soreness. Up again during 2018 instructional league, his fastball was 88-91. He is again day-to-day with shoulder soreness as this list goes to press. 
Healthy Kaprielian will touch 99 and show four impact pitches, including a plus slider and changeup. His pitch grades are nearly identical to A.J. Puk's. Even if his stuff comes back this spring, we'll be hesitant to move him up beyond the 45 FV tier due to the threat of injury recurrence, a specter that could cause Oakland to push him quickly if his stuff bounces back, which means he could feasibly make a big league impact this year if he could just get healthy.","hFv_4TVJwyE","sa658943"

An excellent on-mound athlete with advanced command, Jefferies was 91-93 the summer after he signed, then 92-95 with a reshaped array of secondary offerings the following spring. He looked likely to be a quick-mover, someone who might reach Double-A in his first full season. Alas, his UCL did not cooperate and Jefferies had Tommy John a week after James Kaprielian did. Jefferies returned during 2018 extended spring training and his velocity had totally returned. He was 92-93 early in rehab outings, then 91-95 in his first official AZL game back from surgery, but it would be his last in-game outing of the summer as he was shelved for the remainder of the regular season by a setback. 
Healthy Jefferies has surgical command of a low-90s heater and plus power changeup. So firm is Jefferies' cambio that TrackMan units often mistakenly classify it as a sinker as it resides in the mid-to-upper 80s. It bottoms out late and hard, and is Jefferies' best secondary pitch. His breaking stuff has evolved since college and at last look, he was throwing a fringy curveball that is effective because of his ability to locate it, and an average upper-80s cutter.

The A's still felt compelled to add him to the 40-man this offseason rather than let another team take a $100,000 flier on him in the Rule 5 and hope his fastball/slider combination stuck in their bullpen.

There's skepticism surrounding Biggio's ability to play second base, so the Blue Jays began expanding his defensive horizons last year with time at first and third base, as well as both outfield corners, which is where Biggio saw the most action in the Arizona Fall League. The uppercut nature of Biggio's swing is going to lead to some strikeouts and his aggregate offensive profile looks much less promising in an outfield corner than it would at second base.

When prompted about Hiraldo, pro scouts with coverage in the DSL reiterated what was said about him when he was an amateur. He was physically mature for his age, stocky, and strong, far more muscular than most of his DSL peers.

There's not much room left on his frame for good weight, and he has fairly limited power projection left. Scouts already anticipate a move off of shortstop to either second or third base.

This year it was Young, who hit .285/.363/.445 with 50 extra-base hits and 44 steals for the Lugnuts. The travel ball circuit is not kind to economically disadvantaged families, and part of the reason Young was under-scouted as an amateur, as he told our own David Laurila, was because his family could not afford to attend heavily scouted showcases. 
Another reason he may have slid toward the end of the draft was because he was constantly moving around. He was under the international scouting umbrella while he was young and living in the Bahamas, then spent his early high school years in Florida before relocating to Georgia for his senior season. It's likely that three separate scouts in each org were responsible for scouting and gauging Young's signability. 
The Blue Jays got a deal done for $200,000 and Young has been a strong early-career performer. Pro scouts see him as a bit of a tweener but think there's a chance he might be an everyday center fielder if absolutely everything comes together. He's not a typical center field sprinter (our sources all have either a 50 or 55 on his speed) but he's instinctive, and fine there for now. If Young does move to a corner, his hit/power combination is on the fringe of profiling. A switch-hitter, Young has power from the right side of the plate but he's strikeout prone due to a lack of bat control. As a lefty, he has a gap-to-gap approach and good bat control, but not typical over-the-fence thump.

On the other, he has been hurt a lot -- shoulder surgery, most recently -- and may be painted into too small a defensive corner to be rosterable if he doesn't hit enough to be a regular. It's important to be mindful of prospect fatigue creeping in here, as Leyba really broke out during the summer of 2014 when as a teenager, he hit a combined .323 in the Penn and Midwest Leagues. He was sent to Arizona as part of the three-way, Didi Gregorius-headlined trade that offseason, had a bad 2015 in the Cal League, bounced back in 2016, and has basically been hurt since. 
Because of Leyba's size and lack of power, he has to keep making high-end rates of contact to profile as an everyday player.

Instead of reclassifying and enter the 2015 draft as an 18-year-old, Beer skipped his high school senior year completely and early-enrolled in January at Clemson. He wasn't on the radar for the top couple rounds, so scouts weren't sure he'd perform well, but Beer went on to have one of the best freshman years in college baseball history: .369/.535/.700 with 18 homers, 62 walks, and 27 strikeouts. 
The pessimistic view is that Beer is a player with old skills that peaked that season, as his stats regressed a bit from historic to merely among the best. The optimistic view is that Beer has impact plus-plus raw power, a long track record of production and will fit as an everyday 1B/DH type. We're a bit on the pessimistic side, as Beer is a 20 runner whose athleticism has backed up. He may only fit at DH now and we worried his swing was grooved enough that the hit tool may only be a 40, but with plenty of walks and power. The slippery slope to platoon DH is in sight, so we'd like to see some higher minors performance before we adjust our projections. 
His pro debut was strong and he'll likely spend this year at Hi- and/or Double-A at age 22, age-appropriate for prospects, which will show us where he is on the spectrum of expected performance from Dan Vogelbach to Nate Lowe, or maybe Rhys Hoskins at the very high end.","QgU3Pu8OJ4A","sa3006658"

Sandoval’s fastball sits 88-92 and will top out around 94. He can really spin a 12-6 curveball, one that’s above average when he is getting on top of it. Effectively, Sandoval has an almost perfectly vertical arm slot, but the way he gets there is somewhat odd, and there’s some skepticism among scouts as to the sustainability of last year’s uptick in strike-throwing.

There’s enough of a changeup here for continued development in a rotation and if everything clicks, Sandoval will be a No. 4 or 5 starter.

If amateur scouts are to be believed, any of the following aspects of Hernandez's current profile could change: his stride direction, his arm slot, his breaking ball usage (he has two that bleed together), and the movement profile of his fastball. 
Hernandez was academically ineligible as a sophomore and only started 19 games in three years of college, so there's at least a reason he's behind his peers from a developmental standpoint. He has unteachable arm speed and feel for spin and even if he just ends up as a big league reliever, something that seems pretty reasonable given his talent, it would be a strong outcome for a third round pick.

At some point in 2017, Sosa added a leg kick that drove this improvement, but it didn't pay off in games until 2018, either because he added it too late or because the after-effects of a broken hamate were making his power. Additional evidence that this uptick in power is real is the change in Sosa'a ground ball rate, which has dropped from 50% in '16 and '17 to 38% in '18. Because he's such a free-swinger, Sosa will probably run pretty low OBPs as a big leaguer, but he has barrell control and his hands have life, so he's going to hit some.

Like Didder and Demeritte, hope was bright in the past year that Graham could fix his issues and become a big league contributor, but none of the three have changed much in the interim and now have shorter developmental ropes as they enter their mid-20's.","BF7WH1lskGA","sa658525"

The change was simple: Encarnacion's projection and actions turned into tools with physical development. He now shows 60 raw power in BP, above average arm strength and bat control, and average speed. Encarnacion still has some skills that require growth, as his plate approach is too aggressive to work at the upper levels. And while he has the physical tools to play third base, he's error-prone. The raw tool package and quick-developing statistical performance are a rare combo, so Encarnacion and Cumberland headlined the Orioles' return in the Kevin Gausman trade with Atlanta last summer. It's not a stretch to say Encarnacion has the best tools of any Latin prospect in the Orioles' lower minors, but that's mostly because the Orioles have had a near non-existent international program and their three best international signees (Yusniel Diaz, Encarnacion, Jean Carmona) were all acquired last summer.","Uc8c7Vwd82E","sa921562"

At this point in his development, we just care about the raw spin, a trait of limited malleability, and Santos' is just okay. It's reasonable to hope he grows into elite velocity. The fact that he's throwing this hard at this age and at this size is encouraging, though he's less projectable than one would probably assume given his age and height. All talk of Santos' physical progression centers around reshaping his current frame rather than just adding mass, as he's already pretty filled out. This clouds the fastball projection somewhat, but he'll probably still end up throwing really hard.

Though he thickened quickly in college, Boldt is still an above-average runner once he gets underway. His slow first few steps prevent him from everyday viability in center field, and Boldt saw more time in the outfield corners last year than at any other time during his career. He projects as a platoon corner outfielder, especially if last year's swing changes were just the start of a continuous, upward trend in power output.",,"sa738262"

Then baseball was reinstated as an Olympic sport, and Jax found an avenue to pro ball through the World Class Athlete Program, a military unit focused on training for the Games in the two years leading up to competition. So Jax, having sorted out some arcane rules about Air Force personnel being unable to have second streams of income, is technically an Air Force lieutenant training for the 2020 Olympics, while the Twins pay for his development, but don't pay him.
Jax was 89-94 throughout the 2018 Fall League, with his secondary stuff about average, flashing above (especially the change).

Taylor was acquired from Arizona for Brad Boxberger, and after the Dbacks had taken his early-career development slowly (Taylor was a raw college arm from Canada), the Rays hit the gas pedal and quickly moved him to Montgomery in May. He thrived there, typically throwing 35 to 50 pitches once every three to five days. Most of those pitches are mid-90s fastballs that play up due to big extension, while some are above-average sliders. 
On paper, this reads like a standard two-pitch middle reliever, and for that reason, it's fair to question whether Taylor's usage might be caricaturing his velocity, and if his fastball would be this hard on back-to-back days, or if his usage would be more variable. But if this is just how Tampa Bay is going to use him, then this is the stuff. Taylor threw 78 innings in 38 games. His four starts were some of his shortest outings.

Gaston also isn't classically projectable in that his velocity is already at the top of the scale and he has a maturely-built frame at 6-foot, but he did some arm slot and arm action tinkering over the last few years that has affected his control and command. So while Gaston may get stronger as he physically matures, what's more important is the projection of his feel for pitching, which appears to be more natural at a three-quarters arm slot (more mid-90s velocity), where his arm action is also more naturally online than the higher slot where he was throwing harder and wilder. Gaston's best pitching performance was as the main event on the mound at the Victor Victor Mesa workout in Marlins Park where the better version of his arm slot, arm action, and control was first seen by a large scouting audience. His best off-speed pitch is a solid average curveball and he also has a changeup that flashes average, so the full stuff package, beyond just the fastball, is also top of the scale elite, but Gaston is also hard to project given the varied looks he's given scouts over the last year.","PB7HrCsfEUU",

Originally from Michigan, he pitched at three colleges in three years (Eastern Michigan, Darton State College, and Drury University) in front of various groups of area scouts before he was drafted late in 2016. Sharp is also an ectomorphic 6-foot-4, and his limbs distract and also aid in his down-mound extension, enabling his fastball to sneak up on hitters more often than one would expect given its fringe velocity.

That's not super surprising since Bradley has a clean arm action and some projection to his frame, but that change in perception was mostly because he was the youngest prep prospect in the country -- he'll be 17 even during spring training, younger than many top prospects for the 2019 MLB Draft. Bradley still needs to clean up his delivery some, throw his changeup more often, and fine-tune his command, but his fastball/curveball combo both project for above average, so there's clearly something to work with here.",,"sa3007839"

He's already 19 (on the older end of the spectrum for prospects in the DSL) but is otherwise a well-rounded prospect. He has a good build, is a good athlete, has good stuff (91-94, up to 96 with a 2400 spin rate on the breaking ball) and has on-mound poise. We have him evaluated the way we would an older high school arm who could go anywhere from the third to fifth round in the draft.",,"sa3003164"

The upside here still isn't huge, with all five tools right around average, but Witherspoon has the feel to hit and defend such that he could be a good platoon outfielder who can play all three spots and get a bulk of the at-bats. The realistic outcome if the bat plays and the 22-year-old moves relatively quickly through the minors is a 450 plate appearance outfielder with fringy offense who plays above average corner defense.",,"sa3007047"
"Edgardo Rodriguez","TBR","C","R",,53,,"35+",2023,"High","19.5333333","6' 0""","207","R","R","2017 J2 (TBR)","Venezuela","It's not abundantly clear whether or not Rodriguez will be able to catch as, at age 18, he's already a pretty big, long-levered kid who was initially unsure if he even wanted to try it. But Rodriguez can really hit. He has excellent timing, bat control, and feel for all-fields contact, and he can open up and get his barrel on pitches inside. He might end up at first base or in an outfield corner, but he might hit enough to profile at those spots and if he can catch, his ceiling is sizable.",,"sa3005532"
"Victor Munoz","TBR","RHP","R",,54,,"35+",2023,"High","19.4611111","6' 4""","170","R","R","2017 J2 (TBR)","Dominican Republic","Munoz signed for $442,000 in the 2017 July 2nd period as a second-tier projection arm in the class and he's already showing some progress just over a year after signing. He's 6-foot-4, 170 pounds, with an easy delivery and was already touching 95 mph this summer in the DSL, showing starter traits and spinning a solid average curveball at times. Munoz is roughly the same age and competition level as Taj Bradley, who is a few spots ahead of Munoz on the list. Munoz may have a hair more upside due to projection but Bradley has been seen a lot by scouts over the past year while Munoz was very lightly seen, so we're in a bit of wait-and-see mode here.",,"sa3006381"
