In January of 2019, when most baseball facilities across the country were dark, just feet away from oblivious Peloton riders and tennis-playing retirees, a few lucky scouts and media folks had a religious experience watching the sweetest-swinging teenager on Earth absolutely roast balls fed to his barrel by a high-speed pitching machine. Because of how close you can sit next to the field there, you can feel the sonic force of bat-to-ball impact radiate into your body. When Marco Luciano connects, you feel it to your core. He is not normal. To find bat speed comps you need to look toward Javier Báez, Eric Davis, or whoever the top of your mental catalog might be. And while he already generates plenty of it, Luciano's square-shouldered frame indicated more power might be coming. After hitting the weight room throughout 2020, he weighed in for 2021 Spring Training at a square-shouldered 208, nearly 30 pounds heavier than his 2019 listed weight. The length created by Luciano's natural, uppercut swing is offset by the explosiveness in his hands; he's not particularly strikeout-prone and he doesn't take out-of-control hacks. Unless something unforeseen is exposed about Luciano's approach as he moves through the minors, all of this power seems likely to actualize in games. His AZL walk rate is encouraging early evidence that he's unlikely to be so exposed.
As an athlete and infielder, Luciano is only fair. He might play a passable shortstop one day because his hands and actions are fine most of the time, but he can't presently make strong, accurate throws from multiple platforms and his routine tosses to first don't have that silky smooth shortstop vibe. It looks increasingly likely, especially now that he's added a bunch of weight, that he'll move to either third base or the outfield, enough so that some scouts have him projected there. But it's too early, from a developmental standpoint, to cut bait and move him. He has elite hitting talent, he's produced on paper, and he already has an average exit velo and a hard-hit rate that grade as 65s on the big league scale. If he continues to perform, especially if he hits his way to the upper levels, then this time next year we'll be talking about Marco Luciano as one of the best prospects in baseball, and if he does so while improving his infield defense, perhaps <em>the</em> best. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>","UrZDHmjnjrY","sa3010022"

A college catcher, whose profile is driven by power and defense, goes in the top five but is rushed to the big leagues before his bat is ready, which has potential long-term consequences for his upside. Bart had only seen about a month's worth of at-bats above A-ball before the Giants decided to promote him. He did very well in those 32 games, hitting for huge power at Double-A during the final few weeks of 2019, then for the first two weeks of the 2019 Fall League, until a fractured his right thumb ended his season. In that narrow window of health we saw glimpses of Bart's power with physically fit phalanges. Whether he'll get to his power in games is now in doubt since Bart struck out in 42% of his big league plate appearances in 2020. He was both chasing and missing in the zone at higher rates than the big league average. This comes after 550 minor league plate appearances with a paltry 6% walk rate. Should we have seen an approach red flag here? Bart walked at a 10% clip in college.
With new questions about his bat, Bart's defensive tools become the foundation of his skillset. He's Mike Alstott's size but with the lateral quickness and ground game of a small-framed catcher. He's quick out of his crouch and throws accurate lasers to second base. He also has field general qualities: he's a rousing, vocal leader at times, a calming presence at others. Still likely to be an everyday catcher, Bart's ceiling is now dictated entirely by how much of his power he can get to in games. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>","Cozg_YSvag0","21524"

That turned out to be valuable when they returned in 2019 and half of his 16 homers were hit to the right of center field. Ramos' bat head drags into the zone, which would cause most hitters to be late, but Ramos' swing just scoops fly balls to right field, and his strength pushes them toward the heavens. Some of the strikeout issues (25% at Hi-A, 30% at Double-A) become less concerning when you remember Ramos was 19 years old all year, but they become a bit troubling again when you realize he's destined for a corner. 
Built like a boulder stacked on two Iberico hams, Ramos is already slowing down, and he was an average runner in the 2019 Fall League and has looked rusty in the outfield during his 2021 Spring reps in the outfield. It's not great if he is suddenly a corner guy with whiff/discipline issues, though his plate discipline was much more palatable in 2019.

It's possible he has underlying issues (breaking ball recognition, an expansive approach, or any number of other things) that we just don't know about yet because rookie-level pitching isn't capable of shedding light on them and we lost a bigger, more relevant 2020 sample with which to unearth that stuff.

If a college arm were to come out of the gate with stuff as good as Santos showed during 2020 Instructional League, they'd be the early-season favorite to go first in the draft. Santos worked 97-99 and touched 100 while incorporating both a changeup and slider capable of missing bats, and his sliders are often double-plus. His body is big and maxed out but it's not ""bad,"" and while his delivery looks a little clunky, it's never prevented him from throwing strikes. He's not a touch-and-feel starter type with pinpoint control, but Santos is going to bully the strike zone with plus stuff that tails and bends in different directions. This is not all new from Santos, either, as he's been 93-96 with a plus slider and above-average changeup in the past. The instructs velocity is an indication he's healthy. He looked incredible in the spring of 2019 but two IL stints, including one for a shoulder injury, derailed what could have been a breakout year. There's considerable relief risk here because of the injury history. As such, Santos is on the Top 100 list right next to Luis Medina, who is also 21, has three real weapons, and relief risk.

He's not only a capable hitter from both sides of the plate, but has rare feel for contact from each, utilizing a gap approach from the right side and more of a pull/lift one from the left. Bailey's swing is minimalistic and effective. He can adjust his posture to help him cover the outer half and he's so short to the ball that he can catch fastballs at the top of the zone. 
Bailey's a fine receiver and blocker. He caught on one knee until a runner reached base in college (at least in my looks) but has been entirely on one knee (even with runners on) during 2021 big league spring training, splaying one leg way out to the side to act as a dam for breaking pitches in the dirt. Most of Bailey's good pop times rest around 1.95, which is about average. He has a very good chance to be an everyday catcher but likely lacks the offensive impact to be star, unless he ends up with a 70-grade hit tool, which is in play. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3014442"

After struggling as an underclassman, he arrived for his junior season with a better body and quieter swing, and exploded, slashing .342/.479/.748 in 2019. He sent many non-conference pitches rocketing into Phoenix's midnight sky before he started seeing -- and swinging over the top of -- Pac-12 breaking balls. He was hitting .450 when PAC play began, struck out in 26% of his plate appearances, and finished hitting .342. Whether this was a real problem was the subject of many draft room debates, as was Bishop's relatively short track record of performance. Because the 2020 season was banged due to COVID, we still have very little quantifiable idea of how Bishop will handle a better cross section of breaking balls than he saw early in his junior year. He crushed middle-in pitches at the alt site but continued to waive at back foot breaking stuff. If he can indeed learn to lay off of those or drop the bat head and hit them, then he's going to be a star. 
Bishop has rare physical tools. He's a plus runner and will post 70 run times to first on occasion, has solid feel for center field and huge, playable power. It's unclear why his arm strength dipped as a junior when it was an asset earlier in his career, but it's not a significant part of the skillset and I heard nothing odd about his pre-draft medical, so for now I'm looking the other way.

That meant he had to be seen when he pitched on the road. After he topped out at 94 during his pre-draft summer, Harrison was up to 97 in the Fall of 2020. This is not a traditional high school pitching prospect. Harrison has a prototypical frame but his delivery is an anomaly. He gets very low to the ground and takes a huge stride home, then throws two-seamers from a sidearm slot. The combination of the low slot and drop-and-drive style delivery creates a very low release point, and then flat, sometimes upward angle on Harrison's fastballs. He can create arm-side tailing action on his heater (to set up a precocious changeup) and also run it up the ladder. And of course because Harrison's slot makes him a very uncomfortable at-bat for left-handed hitters, and his curveball has the sweeping action most readers associate with a lower-slot lefty pitcher, that pitch is very likely to have at least some amount of utility. He looked like a sinker pitchability prospect during my high school looks but the spike in velocity and improved fastball utility raise his ceiling considerably. Now we're looking at a young prospect who had a pitchability foundation, albeit one with a strange look, experiencing a pretty significant velocity spike. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em>","1AlmnfSq0xE","sa3014513"

Toribio's approach is geared for all-fields contact but he's so strong that he often hits for power by mistake. More than any of the other young hitters on this list, and more than most college underclass hitters the same age, Toribio is a fully formed physical entity, a brawny, heavy-footed thumper who looks like Aramis Ramirez did in his prime. That sort of physicality at this age creates risk that he'll outgrow third base, and it's very likely that, even if he stays there, he'll only be passable at the position. But over the last year he's not only kept his body in check but has actually become a bit more svelte and cut. Toribio's power and feel to hit -- he has some head violence when he takes big hacks, but still generates a loud, heavy thwack when his swing is more controlled and precise -- means he might profile at first base should he have to move. If he stays at third and the bat-to-ball skills hold, he could be an above-average regular. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3005541"

Corry walked a batter every other inning that year, and yet it was his most consistent stretch of strike-throwing as a pro. His heater wandered again throughout 2020 instructs, but Corry exhibited an uptick in velocity there (92-95 in my look, which is up from 90-94 in 2019). Though it's not as consistent as his shapely curveball, Corry's changeup has improved in pro ball, giving him three viable weapons. It's starter's stuff with reliever's control, which is why Corry projects as a multi-inning reliever at present. 
Ordinarily I'd worry about Corry's curveball playing down a bit because it's paired with a sinker, but it has really great depth and, at times, some arm-side action that gives it extra utility against righty hitters. Folks who have seen young Tigers lefty Tarik Skubal can use that as a fair delivery comp for Corry, who also has a swooping, high-3/4s arm swing that creates tough angle on his stuff, though Corry's isn't as loose and fluid as Skubal's. He's a fairly stiff, short strider, just not the type of on-mound athlete who typically ends up starting. But again, Corry has a heavy mid-90s fastball with tough angle, a plus curveball, and enough sink on his change to induce weak contact, at least. I think this sort of pitcher is best deployed as a four-out fireman. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em> ","vE93W5dEN5w","sa3004648"

He lacked the strikeout-to-walk ratios usually associated with the analytically-driven first round college hitters but he was very young for a college player, still just 20 on draft day. Wilson's hands work great in the box and his swing is as compact as his frame, so he's tough to beat with velo. It's becoming more common for teams to seek profiles like Wilson's, in the Jedd Gyrko/Paul DeJong mold. Defensive issues that might disqualify a player in a vacuum are hidden by improved defensive positioning, and it lets teams shoehorn someone with more pop than is ordinary at a valuable position. This encapsulates Wilson, who is seeing time all over the infield. He doesn't have the pitch-tracking/hand-eye skills I typically associate with that kind of hitter but he's going to make a ton of contact because of how short his swing is, and a lot of it will be hard because of his bat speed. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3009871"

He ended up at Stanford, but missed his draft-eligible sophomore year due to a stress reaction in his back. When he returned as a redshirt sophomore, Beck's stuff was back but his command was often erratic. The Braves took a fourth-round flier on him in 2018, and by the time they traded him to San Francisco for Mark Melancon in 2019, Beck was throwing harder and working with a much better changeup. 
He now has four viable pitches. The curveball is still the headliner, but the change is flashing plus now, too. He was sitting 93-94 when I saw him in the Fall. If I shot him with the high speed camera that day, I can't find the files. His previous slomo footage (in the linked video) showed clear room for improvement in his fastball release. That's from his first start with the Giants org, and it's possible that's gotten better.

But he does have ridiculous power and elite bat speed, way up there in Clint Frazier land, which gives Canario a power-driven pathway to everyday duty. 
Canario struggled with swing and miss all over the zone at the Giants' alternate site but he also continued to barrel pitches down and away from him. A lot of pull-heavy power hitters like the inside pitch, but Canario is best when he's getting extended and catching stuff away from him. His swing is a bit grooved, and he can't move the bat all over the zone to make good contact; it just comes middle-away. He came to 2020 instructs a high-priority evaluation for opposing teams because of his pending 40-man/Rule 5 deadline, and matters were complicated when Canario tore his left labrum and needed surgery. It arguably made him more draftable in the Rule 5 since he could perhaps spend more of the following year on the IL. The Giants 40-man'd the raw 20-year-old, but he's probably behind several NRI players on any sort of practical org depth chart because his at-bat quality is so green. This is a risky corner bat, but Canario has potential middle-of-the-order talent because of the raw power.

The Trackman readout for Doval is shocking. His primary fastball/cutter spins in at about 2700 rpm, which is incredible considering how hard he throws. He also generates nearly seven feet of extension, and the effective velocity of his fastball is about 2 mph harder than its actual velo. There are outings where he's untouchable for several innings. He also has nuclear outings where he walks everyone and gives up a bunch of runs before registering an out; this has now been the case for several years. 
Doval has been 94-97 during 2021 spring training and is on the 40-man, but is still a prospect of extreme variance since his stuff has almost no precedent and I can't decide if that's good or not.

Genovés is procedurally advanced for a 20-year-old, and he has the leadership qualities and intangibles that have an outsized impact at catcher. Because he's going to stay back there and because he has impact power, enough to put balls out to right center, Genovés has a puncher's chance to be a regular. 
There's some obvious positional redundancy in this org. Joey Bart and Patrick Bailey (especially as a hitter) are both more advanced than Genovés, but Genovés' 40-man timeline (he's already Rule 5 eligible at age 21) means he'll need to be rostered before Bailey. That might compress his development in a weird way, or make him a trade candidate. There are lots of catchers who only first make an offensive impact in their mid-20s and most of them are like Genovés: huge-framed guys with power.

The quality of that curveball varies, but it has been his secondary of choice throughout this spring, when Castro's fastball has again been sitting mid-90s, touching 98 just before list publication. It's possible that Castro shows rapid improvement in his breaking balls consistency because a) this guy is a converted catcher, b) he's missed a year and a half of development rehabbing from TJ and c) based on my in-person notes, he was once a fastball/changeup guy and the curveball might be very new. Converted pitchers who become impact bullpen arms typically have 18-24 month ascents (Jason Motte, Kenley Jansen, Joe Nathan, Sean Doolittle, etc. all happened fast, with Carlos Marmol and Alexi Ogando the two exceptions I'm aware of), but this guy converted very young and missed a bunch of time because of surgery.

Due to the incredible arm speed Mercedes generates and the length of his arm action, and because the two delivery comps that come to mind here are a wild reliever (Doval) and a unicorn type with maybe Earth’s best changeup (Castillo), I did come away from the look with relief concerns due to the delivery even though there are starter traits present in his body and athleticism. Because Mercedes’ fastball has tailing action, even at 94-98 it has less margin for error that those with carry and perceived rise. This fastball shape fits best with a changeup and I did see one nasty 91 mph cambio from Mercedes last night, but his secondary of choice right now is his slider. It’s in the mid-80s, his feel for it comes and goes, and he back doored two of them. There were times when, thrown one after another, the divergent movement of Mercedes’ fastball and slider made hitters very uncomfortable.

He doesn't currently repeat his delivery consistently enough for that. But he has a chance to, which means he could end up with several bat-missing offerings and profile comfortably in a rotation.
