Sent to the Arizona Fall League for extra reps, Bart was the league's star pupil before he was hit by two pitches in the same game, the second of which fractured his right thumb. That ended his season but in that narrow window of health we saw glimpses of Bart's power with physically fit phalanges. And we had plenty of looks at his power, particularly to his pull side, in college, including a titanic blast that cleared the facade of Georgia Tech's football complex in left field and was never found. 
The defensive tools are the foundation of Bart's skillset, the cornerstone of a certain big league future. He's Mike Alstott's size but with the lateral quickness and ground game of a small-framed catcher. He's quick out of his crouch and throws accurate lasers to second base. He also has field general qualities: he's a rousing, vocal leader at times, a calming presence at others. We still have some questions about the hit tool -- we posited Bart was just frustrated by being pitched around in college and developed some bad habits, but he was swing-happy again in 2019. Still, we think he'll get to much or all of his power, play all-world defense, and be an All-Star catcher, a proper heir apparent to Buster Posey.","Cozg_YSvag0","sa3007786"
"Marco Luciano","SFG","SS",,24,2,,"55",2023,,"18.7638888","6' 2""","180","R","R",2018,"J2","SFG",2600000,"Dominican Republic","The Giants dusty, tightly-confined backfields abut a gym with the sort of athleisure-wearing clientele you'd expect in Scottsdale. Last January, when most baseball facilities across the country were dark, just feet away from oblivious Peloton riders and tennis-playing retirees, a lucky few scouts and media folks had a religious experience watching the sweetest-swinging teenager on Earth absolutely roast balls fed to his barrel by a high-speed pitching machine. Because of how close you can sit next to the field there, you can feel the sonic force of bat-to-ball impact radiate into your body. When Marco Luciano connects, you feel it to your core. He is not normal. To find bat speed comps you need to look toward Javier Baez, Eric Davis, whatever the top of your mental catalog might be. And while he already generates plenty of it, Luciano's square-shouldered frame indicates more power might be coming. The length created by Luciano's natural, uppercut swing is offset by the explosiveness in his hands; he's not particularly strikeout-prone and he doesn't take out-of-control hacks. Unless something unforeseen about Luciano's approach is exposed as he moves through the minors, all of this power seems likely to actualize. His AZL walk rate is encouraging early evidence that he's unlikely to be so exposed.
As an athlete and infielder, Luciano is only fair. He might play a passable shortstop one day because his hands and actions are fine most of the time, but he can't presently make strong, accurate throws from multiple platforms. It looks increasingly likely that he'll move to the outfield, enough so that some scouts have him projected there, but it's too early to cut bait and move him. He has elite hitting talent, he's produced on paper, and he already has average exit velos and a hard-hit rate that grade as 65 on the scale. If he continues to perform, especially if the Giants send him right to Augusta and he hits his way to San Jose, then this time next year we'll be talking about Marco Luciano as one of the best prospects in baseball, and if he does so while improving his infield defense, perhaps <em>the</em> best.","UrZDHmjnjrY","sa3010022"

That turned out to be valuable when they returned last year, and half of his 16 homers were hit to the right of center field. Ramos' bat head drags into the zone, which would cause most hitters to be late, but Ramos' swing just scoops fly balls to right field, and his strength pushes them toward the heavens. Some of the strikeout issues (25% at Hi-A, 30% at Double-A) become less concerning when you remember Ramos was 19-years-old all year, but they become a bit troubling again when you realize he's destined for a corner. 
Built like a boulder stacked on two Iberico hams, Ramos is already slowing down, and he was an average runner in the Fall League. It's not great if he is suddenly a corner guy with whiff/discipline issues, though his plate discipline was much more palatable last year. Retaining that will be important or we're just talking about a Randal Grichuk sequel.","ytZlP4TQI48","sa3004693"

After struggling as an underclassman, he arrived for his junior season with a better body and quieter swing, and broke out. He sent many non-conference pitches rocketing into Phoenix's midnight sky before he started seeing -- and swinging over the top of -- Pac-12 breaking balls. Whether this is fixable was the subject of many draft room debates, as was Bishop's relatively short track record of performance. 
Bishop has rare physical tools. He's a plus runner and will post 70 run times to first on occasion, has solid feel for center field and huge, playable power. It's unclear why his arm strength dipped last year when it was an asset earlier in his career, but it's not a significant part of the skillset and we heard nothing odd about his pre-draft medical, so we're looking the other way. He'll be a top 100 prospect as soon as we're more confident in the hit tool.","qccYljFGcVc","sa3011413"

He's a capable hitter from both sides of the plate, utilizing a gap approach from the right side and more of a pull/lift one from the left. He's a fine receiver and blocker, catching on one knee until a runner reaches base. Most of Bailey's good pop times rest around 1.95, which is about average. He has a very good chance to be an everyday catcher but likely lacks the offensive impact to be star.",,

He was a DSL All-Star before coming stateside for the homestretch of the AZL, and the Orange Giants dropped him right in the top of their playoff lineup. An outfield collision soon ended his season, though he left the field under his own power holding a towel to his face. 
Matos isn't a huge-framed outfielder but he projects for plus raw power at peak anyway, because of his ability to rotate. He also has plus speed and he was selectively aggressive during his brief AZL trial, taking big hacks in hitters counts rather than all the time. It's possible he has underlying issues (breaking ball recognition, expansive approach, any number of things) that we just don't know about yet because rookie-level pitching isn't capable of shedding light on them. But just on tools, Matos belongs in the same general area as most of the top high schoolers from the 2019 draft, which puts him a shade beneath the tier of prospect who'll be on our top 100 list this offseason.",,"sa3008756"

He had Tommy John midway through 2016, and the little bit of 2017 for which he was healthy he spent in a strictly-regimented relief role. Finally back in a rotation the following year, Webb blew up. He was holding 92-95 deep into starts, topping out at 97, and spinning in a dastardly slider. Unrefined fastball control indicated relief risk at the time, but the injury and timing of Webb's surgery robbed him of reps, so it was fair to project slightly better control. 
Early in 2019, Webb was popped for PEDs and suspended for 80 games. Upon return, the fastball was down, more 91-94, and it settled there throughout 2019. But Webb's changeup has improved and a clearly demarcated two-seamer will help it play. The command piece is still not always there, particularly early in games, but at other times Webb has arm-side feel for the change, glove-side feel for his slider, and and he'll show east/west command of the heater. It's No. 4/5 stuff, shaded on either side of the slash depending on how the command and changeup progress.",,"17995"

Wilson was not a traditional first round talent based on visual evalauations. He's a relatively projectionless, medium-framed infielder without a clear plus tool, and he lacked the strikeout-to-walk ratios first round collegiate players usually exhibit. But, his hands work great in the box, his swing is as compact as his frame (making it possible for him to get on top of high fastballs), he tracks breaking balls very well, and he was very young for a college player, still just 20 on draft day. Some scouts on the amateur side wanted him to catch in pro ball and thought he had the toughness to do it. Others think he'll be a fine 2B or 3B defender with a balanced, stable offensive profile. There is very likely limited ceiling here, probably something close to an average regular, but Wilson is also a fairly high probability contributor because of his bat-to-ball skills and defensive profile.",,"sa3009871"

That sort of physicality at this age creates risk that he'll outgrow third base, and it's very likely that, even if he stays there, he'll only be passable at the position. 
Toribio's power and feel to hit -- he has some head violence when he takes big cuts, but still generates a loud, heavy thwack when his swing is more controlled and precise -- means he might profile at first base should he have to move. We don't expect much more raw power to come because he is already so physically mature. We're going to monitor his platoon splits over the next year because, to the eye, he's much less adept at picking up lefty stuff, perhaps concerningly so, but there's not nearly enough data to support that yet. If he stays at third and the bat-to-ball skills hold, he could be an above-average regular. The low-end of the potential outcomes is a platoon first baseman.",,"sa3005541"

But he does have ridiculous power and bat speed, which enables him to make impact, all-fields contact even when he mis-hits balls. This is a risky corner bat, but Canario has potential middle-of-the-order talent because of the raw power and a good chance to get to it in games because his swing has natural lift. There's huge ceiling if the hit/approach component improves.","tMkRAh9baAM","sa3003316"

He seemed to be on the big league fast track when the Red Sox asked him to play center field that fall, but it took two trades and year of rehab from a torn ACL before he finally cracked a big league lineup. First sent from Boston (which signed him) to Milwaukee along with Travis Shaw as part of a lopsided package for Tyler Thornburg, Dubon was traded to San Francisco last summer in exchange for Drew Pomeranz. 
Most of Dubon's role is tied to his ability to make contact, a skill derived from strong hand-eye coordination and bat control. His formerly slender, willowy frame has filled out some, and in 2018 Dubon stopped scrubbing his leg kick with two strikes, but he's still not getting much out of his lower half and his contact quality is entirely dependent on barrel accuracy, which will limit him to doubles power. Defensively, Dubon is passable at shortstop and second base. Ideally, in a reserve role, he'd be able to play center field as well, but aside from the five games he played there in 2016, he's only ever played the middle infield. His home-to-first times were down a bit last year coming off the ACL injury, so either the top-end speed he once had (we've had a 6 on Dubon's wheels each of the last several years, until now) will return, or he'll need to show immediate feel for center for him to see big league reps there. We have him in as a contact-oriented utility player.","MgNeizABbjY","16530"

He's a fairly stiff, short strider and often has scattershot fastball control -- he walked a batter every other inning last year -- so there's significant relief risk here. We're not inclined to project on Corry's control enough to consider him a starter, but we like him as a bat-missing, multi-inning reliever who ends up throwing 90 or so innings.","vE93W5dEN5w","sa3004648"

Then he was shut down because of the shoulder and wound up throwing only 34 innings all year.

Hjelle's (it's pronounced like peanut butter and _____ ) fastball only sits in the low-90s but plays up because of extension, life, and the angle created by his height. Those traits in concert with one another make for a heater that competes for whiffs in the zone. The secondaries are closer to average, often below, though Hjelle can locate them.

He had been a raw, arm strength goon for what seemed like forever, and he remains concerningly wild; he may be better off dumping his slider in to get ahead of hitters and then chucking the fastball by them, rather than the other way around. Ultimately, he has late-inning, elite closer stuff but a fairly low chance of actualizing. We put a 45 FV on the top tier of pure, two-pitch relievers (most elite closers are failed starters) and Adon deserves that sort of consideration, but his track record of wildness and advanced age have him just shy of that.","6ghLcOh-UlI","sa873314"

Pomares only makes impact contact to his pull side but he does have the ability to slash balls the other way. He punishes pitchers who try to double up on breaking balls against him, and he has several other hitterish traits. He's not a speedster and has more of a tweener defensive profile, so he probably needs more game power to profile in a corner.

He's been a bit more visible since then, and the carrying tool is going to be the glove. Arteaga's range, footwork, actions, and athleticism are all terrific. He doesn't have a clear path to an impact bat based on what teams have seen so far, but his frame is projectable. He may be stateside in January.",,
