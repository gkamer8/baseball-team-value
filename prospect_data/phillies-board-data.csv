He and Casey Mize are back to back on the Top 100: guys with front end stuff, but recent injuries. Howard's fastball was sitting 93-97 deep into his best 2019 Fall League outings but only averaged 94 in 2020, and his command backed up, too. I'm taking a longview here. Remember that we're talking about a small school pop-up reliever who, due to a past shoulder injury and the pandemic, has just one full pro season as a starter. Howard has impact stuff. His changeup is plus, he can blow his fastball past lefties near their hands, his slider has big time action to his glove side, and his low-70s curveball is a nice look to present hitters the second and third time through the lineup. His breaking ball lacked backfoot angle in 2020 but, based on how Howard has described his shoulder issues impacting how he pitched, that may come if he and the Phillies staff can find a way to put the shoulder problems in the rearview. There are three or four bat-missing pitches in Howard's bag when he's and loose. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>","hEr3iNdRJmg","23252"

While Abel's sitting fastball velocity slipped throughout his showcase summer, he was still reaching back for 97 early in outings and the rest of his profile was more complete than other prep arms, so even though his senior season was cancelled because of COVID-19, he was the first high school pitcher selected in the 2020 Draft. Then, aside from some remote live BP work during the summer, he rested until Instructional League where he once again showed big, mid-90s gas.

He has a traditional power pitcher's fastball/slider combination, while the upper-80s changeup (it was 87-89 during 2020 instructs) remains firm and unrefined, as does his control. Morales is a good athlete -- he's sinewy and strong -- while his delivery is violent and difficult to repeat. One of those will usurp the other and dictate what happens to Morales' role. I think he'll be a ninth inning bully. From a size and athleticism standpoint, I think Morales is very similar to prospect-era Dylan Bundy and Daniel Espino, who were better executing a deeper rertoire at the same age. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3004581"

It's not often pretty, but he hits balls hard consistently. The offensive ingredient we don't know about yet is the plate discipline. Right now we're talking about a 6% walk rate across 550 career plate appearances. Some may have some more data from stuff collected at extended or instructs during that time.

I've seen a bunch of him since his sophomore year at UNLV and still don't know. He can move the bat head all over the zone but doesn't do damage everywhere. I've seen him homer on pitches at the top of the zone, and go down and golf them out off his shoe tops, he  is great at adjusting to breaking balls mid-flight, and more and more of those are being thrown at the big league level. I've also seen him be late on a lot of fastballs, and end up topping them into the ground. Sometimes he'll flare pitches he's late on over the head of the opposing shortstop, but there is a way to pitch to him to limit damage if you execute, which was evident at the alt site as well. I've dialed down Stott's game power projection because of this, making it imperative he stays at short. He's a big guy with an atypical throwing stroke. I had him projected to stay at short last year and there's basically no new info on this end, but not all the four corners scouts, who saw him play defense most of all, thought he could. The snapshot of the profile -- a lefty-hitting shortstop with power -- is still a prospectdom rarity, but I'm growing skeptical about the in-game power matching the raw based on the alt site look. <em>(Alternate site)</em>","qccYljFGcVc","sa3011443"

Even though he didn't hit his first pro home run until he was in the big leagues, Marchan's left-handed swing might enable him to hit for a little bit of pull pop, and opposing pitchers should be wary of his ability to turn on velocity under his hands. He has less ability to do damage out and away from him, and his right-handed swing is far inferior to his left. There's still feel for the barrel from the right side, but a less-connected lower half; Marchan just sort of throws the bat head at the ball as a right-handed hitter and can't hit for power from that side. He's also a suitable, but unspectacular defensive catcher. He'll catch on one knee for certain pitchers but not for others, and his lateral mobility is noticeably hampered when he does. Marchan's ball-blocking has improved but is still not great, like a hockey goalie who gives up longer rebounds. From a skills standpoint, he's not all that different from Adrian Del Castillo (a likely first round catcher in this year's draft) or even Keibert Ruiz, but the mediocre defense and ability to turn him around and neuter his offense prevented Marchan from entering the top 100. He projects as a low-end regular or even timeshare catcher sort, which teams badly need, and he's big league ready. He's a high-profile trade candidate now that J.T.

He was living toward the higher end of that range during 2020 instructs, sitting 92-95. Miller's secondary stuff is also very promising. His changeup was his best weapon in college but his two breaking balls each have big spin. They're already quite good even thought they're maybe not totally spin efficient, according to a front office source citing a gap between Miller's breaking balls' raw traits and observed movement.

He has great plate coverage and can poke well-located fastballs on the outside corner to left field, while staying back on breaking balls and hooking those into the right field corner or right-center gap. The high-end feel for contact enabled Moniak to be a little swing-happy as an amateur but it's made him a lower OBP hitter in pro ball, and his expected stats in 2019 were closer to a .310 OBP and .410 SLG rather than the .440 mark he posted in Reading (ah, Reading). He's filled out and the raw power looks like it's going to settle close to average based on sourced exit velos and my 2019 Fall League looks (which weren't good until the last week or two). The Phillies 2021 roster could perhaps use a lefty-hitting outfielder to compliment Kingery/Segura/McCutchen and provide late-game run prevention help, but Roman Quinn has the defensive edge over Moniak and Adam Haseley.  <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>","HFfelseQ8mo","19956"

Then we had no 2020 Low-A sequel season by which to evaluate Garcia's progress; instead, all we have is his Instructional League look, which was very glove-centric. Indeed, Garcia is an excellent young defensive shortstop but doesn't have clear everyday offensive ability. He may still grow into requisite strength but we're not talking about a traditionally projectable 6-foot-2 frame here, as Garcia's a shorter, stockier guy. He's starting to track more like a high-probability utility infielder. If he ends up a regular, it'll be because his feel for contact drives his offensive profile, and as a young switch-hitter with some barrel variability, I think that's possible.

He can rip his hands through and get the barrel on pitches inside, and he can spoil tough pitches on the edge of the zone. There's rare bat-to-ball feel here, which enables a swing-happy approach that could use refining. Muzziotti's exit velo data is not great, he lacks much frame-based projection, and he's been hurt a bit.

Especially toward the end of his college carrer, Martin's approach was less discerning than Mike Richards in an Old City bar at 1:45 AM, and Martin often swung at pitches at his eyes or in the other batter's box. His physical tools are scintillating, though, and Martin is not only an elite runner and athlete but has plus pull power, too. Even if he ends up with a 35 or 40 bat because his approach remains poor, Martin will still do enough damage to be some kind of role player, like Ian Happ (though Martin's statistical track record in college was not as strong as Happ's), or a more athletic Yairo Muñoz. The other most significant part of his development will then be finding as many defensive positions for him to play as possible. Martin makes lots of effort- and athleticism-based plays but is pretty crude from a hands/actions standpoint on defense, which is where the Happ comp is most true.

During 2020 instructs, he was not only healthy but throwing harder, sitting 90-94 throughout camp and 93-95 at his best. That extra velo is made tougher to hit because Falter is pretty funky and deceptive. His glove raise is like a magician's misdirection and he takes a gargantuan stride home, generating seven feet, three inches of extension.

Instead, Garcia had to wait until March of 2020 to sign due to age misrepresentation, as he was a full year older than indicated.

He is very talented, though, and has one of the better baseball builds in all of the minors, a physique that rivals Luis Robert's.

The power gives him a real shot to be a regular, and while the peripherals make him very scary, Ortiz gets some grace for being 20 in the Florida State League in 2019 even though he had a sub-.300 OBP. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em>","HQy76_5oRQc","sa920180"

In the year leading up to the deal, Sánchez's velo climbed from 88-93 to the 92-95 range, topping out at 98, in multi-inning relief stints and starts lasting as long as five innings. Then, even as the Phillies bullpen was getting shelled, Sánchez languished away at the alternate site with diminished velocity (he was only up to 95 as a starter there, sitting 91-94). He continued to pitch in LIDOM, working most often with his fastball, then his mid-80s changeup, then equal parts curveball and slider. I think he's likely to remain stretched out and be a spot starter during his option years and then move into the bullpen once he's out of them. That'll give Sánchez time to try to find a true bat-missing secondary, which he'll need in relief. If he can do that (I'm assuming an eventual velo bump in the 'pen), he could end up in a leveraged role, but I'm not projecting that right now. <em>(Alternate site, LIDOM)</em>",,"sa828749"
