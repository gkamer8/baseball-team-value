He redshirted, then only threw 36 innings the following spring and began his draft year in the bullpen, a relative unknown. He moved to the rotation in March and crosscheckers started showing up to see him much later than is typical for a first look at a second round talent. In 2018, his first full season as a member of the rotation, Howard thrived and late in the year his stuff took off. He was sitting 94-98 and working with three nasty secondary pitches. That carried over to his first four starts of 2019 but was interrupted by shoulder soreness that benched him for two months. After he returned, the Phillies moved him pretty quickly to Double-A for six starts, then had him finish in the Fall League. His stuff was great in Arizona. He touched 99, sat mostly 93-97, his curveball and changeup were both plus, and his slider's two-plane tilt gives Howard a second viable breaker, capable of garnering whiffs when it's located away from righties. He barely pitched at Double-A last year and is likely to start 2020 there, but if he's good for a month, especially in hitter-friendly Reading, then a promotion to Lehigh Valley makes sense. If at any point the competitive Phillies think he's one of their five best arms, he needs to be in the big leagues.","hEr3iNdRJmg","sa3004923"

Bohm's swing now more closely resembles Michael Brantley's, not some strikeout-heavy slugger's uppercut hack. His hands start high and stay tucked before he simply guides them down to wherever the ball is. If anything, this swing is less noisy than his college iteration, and somehow a 6-foot-5, long-levered guy with big power managed to have just a 14% strikeout rate at Double-A last year. Bohm has enough raw power to hit balls hard even with a low-effort cut, and he's been able to hit balls all over the zone because of how direct his swing is. Can he play third base? I came away from my extended Fall League look more optimistic than almost every scout I talked to. I have him projected as a 40 defender there in part because Philly is likely very motivated to leave him at third as long as Rhys Hoskins is around.","aWTFRuSheGI","sa3007284"

He has the prototype starter's frame at a broad-shouldered 6-foot-4, he already throws hard and might throw harder as that frame fills out, he has strong natural proclivity for spinning his breaking stuff, and he'll also flash a really good changeup once in a while. His sitting fastball velocity slipped throughout his showcase summer while Jared Kelley's did not, but Abel was still reaching back for 97 early in outings and the rest of his profile is more complete than other pre arms. His location and the timing of the COVID-19 shutdown mean Abel didn't pitch in varsity games this spring, but he threw deeper into the fall than most of his peers in the preceding few years and might actually benefit from the extra rest, especially after what happened to his velo throughout last summer.","Eqc625r-XdY",

There were the teams that thought that, despite his size and atypical throwing stroke, he'd stay at shortstop and hit for some power because his swing has natural lift. Those teams were highest on him. Then there were teams that thought he'd just do one of those things. Stott is a waist-bender, and his lower half is tight. I think he'll be okay at short but acknowledge that all else equal, I'd be more comfortable with a traditionally graceful shortstop. 
Stott's swing is geared for low-ball contact. It's pretty, and Stott can hit pitches near his shoe-tops to all fields with power, but he needs to prove he can hit velocity at the top of the strike zone, which he'll face a lot. The swing's length and bat path create doubt. This profile is rare: it's a lefty-hitting shortstop with power, but one riskier than is typical for a college bat who has two years of strong numbers.","qccYljFGcVc","sa3011443"

This is still a switch-hitting teenage middle infielder with promising gap-to-gap pop.

There's rare bat-to-ball feel here, which enables a swing-happy approach that could use refining. Muzziotti's exit velo data is not great, he lacks much frame-based projection, and he's been hurt a bit.

His pre-draft skill overview was as follows: contact-first bat, with a chance to be elite in that regard, instincts-driven center field, and a relatively narrow band of framed-based raw power projection. Moniak has filled out and the raw power looks like it's going to settle close to average, based on sourced exit velos and my Fall League looks (which weren't good until the last week or two). Org opinions differ as to whether or not a better approach can be taught. A more selective Moniak might walk and slug a little more, and swing at pitches he can hit, but not in a way that does damage. I have him in as a low-end regular, a .310 OBP, .420 SLG sort of center fielder.","HFfelseQ8mo","sa917920"

Like Teheran, Medina is an athletic sinker/changeup righty, but he arguably has a better breaking ball than Teheran does. Before touching the vertical movement monolith and leaping into the new frontier of fastball understanding, I had boundless enthusiasm for Medina. It eventually became clear his fastball just wasn't going to play like a mid-90s heater. The secondaries -- a sweeping breaking ball in the 77-82 mph range and that changeup -- and command projection were still strong, though. Last year, Medina's walk and strikeout rates backed up on him. He has to have pretty fine command for everything to gel into a No. 4/5 starter; if that aspect of the skillset bounces back, he'll move into that appropriate 45 FV tier.","gWbQ93TNwqg","sa832877"

He still struggles to squeeze good breaking balls and with ball-blocking, but neither is so bad that Marchan is sure to move elsewhere, though he has played some first base.

Then Llovera pitched with diminished stuff and was shut down with an elbow issue in mid-July shortly after a bullpen trial.

Maton is a lefty bat who can play both middle infield spots (and began playing some third base in 2019), he walks (10% career rate), and he hits the ball in the air a ton (33% career groundball rate). He's also performed at every stop and checks a lot of visual, athletic boxes. The raw power, though, is lacking. Because Maton already hits the ball in the air a lot (he averaged 18 degrees on launch), there's not a lot of room for cream at the top of his offensive profile that doesn't involve him adding either strength or overhauling his swing in a way that unlocks power. At age 23, the former is unlikely, but with a fairly new dev staff in place on the hitting side, perhaps the latter is. 
Realistically, he's a good utility guy, but perhaps the feel for lift and the Triple-A/major league baseball gives him a shot to break out.","ZCny3WKOqrU","sa876186"

He even got a little bit of run in center field last year, but at age 21, Ortiz is built like Jose Abreu is right now and is probably destined for right field or first base. I once thought a DH/1B future was a lock, but Ortiz has stayed fairly mobile and at this point, we have no idea what kind of infield hands he has.

He has fastball-heavy starter stuff and repertoire depth, but below-average command will probably limit him to inefficient, five-ish inning outings, or perhaps move him to the bullpen.

He runs well enough underway that there's a faction of scouts who think he might stay in center field, which would take some pressure off the swing-and-miss profile. The selectivity is the thing that really needs to improve here.",,"sa3006903"

He has ""reverse projection,"" meaning he's young enough to reshape an otherwise unprojectable build and add velocity through improved conditioning. Philly has targeted heavier-bodied pitchers in international free agency (Castillo, Morales, Santos) and Lin is another. His delivery is fairly loose and fluid, especially for his size. The secondary stuff is raw, but Lin had a strong statistical 2019 in a three-ish inning piggyback role with Williamsport.","WkzSCox18dI","sa3008535"
