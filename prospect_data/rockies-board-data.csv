His in-the-box actions are quiet and smooth up until the moment he decides to unleash hell on the baseball. He can clear his hips and crush balls in, and he can also extend his arms and crush pitches away from him to the opposite field gap. Because of the frame-based power potential, Veen was one of a handful of high schoolers who had a chance to really blow up during his senior spring and insert himself among the college prospects atop this draft, and because high school ball began in Florida before the COVID-19 pandemic, teams got to see some of that development and Veen separated himself from some of the other prep hitters. He's a prototypical power-hitting high school prospect. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em> ","R99-tVNzoU4","sa3014516"

He can make contact with pitches all over the zone but typically does his damage slugging pitches on the inner half, especially wayward lefty fastballs in there. Watch how his groundball rate trends in 2021. The 2019 swing that may have helped bring his groundball rate closer to average (50% previously, down to 42% in '19) has again been changed, so it's hard to say how much damage he's going to be capable of now. 
A high school shortstop, Vilade began seeing time at third base in 2019, then took reps in the outfield during the Rockies' fall workouts, and at the 2020 alternate site and in instructs. He's a heavy-footed, 40-grade athlete who isn't likely to be a good defender anywhere, but might be a replacement-level defender in a couple of spots (hopefully some third base, more likely first base and left field). While he certainly has the raw juice (this guy was putting balls way out of Wrigley Field in a high school home run derby), Vilade hasn't produced the kind of game power to be a 50 FV, everyday type of regular in my opinion, though he did have some Top 100 support from folks who work for analytically-inclined clubs. Vilade's feel for contact makes him a likely role-playing sort who I hope continues to see some third base time. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3004256"

Romo also switch-hits and has huge raw power and bat speed, but there were serious pre-draft concerns about his ability to make contact, which is what drove some teams to think he'd head to school rather than sign, but the Rockies took him early enough to keep him from LSU. High school catching is scary and players from that demographic bust a lot. Go back and read any Adley Rutschman or MJ Melendez report from when they graduated high school and they read, in broad strokes, exactly the same as Romo's does right now (plus glove/arm, frame, athleticism, power), and that's how variable his developmental trajectory may be.

That's an intriguing group. He has mistake power from both sides of the plate but also some limitations. As a right-handed hitter, Toglia is adept at punishing pitches at the top of the strike zone, working gap to gap depending on whether the pitch is on the inner or outer half. As a lefty, he has a low-ball, bottom-hand-dominant swing, and he'll hit some pretty-looking golf shots out to his pull side, or scoop some balls to the oppo gap. If lefty pitchers can execute back-foot breakers against him, they're going to get him out. He's vulnerable to letter-high velocity from the left side. I think there will be enough offensive ability for Toglia to be a low-end everyday first baseman held back from the 50 FV tier because I don't think his plate coverage is air-tight.

Now McMahon consistently touches 96 or 97 during his outings and sits in the 91-95 range, his fastball has tail and sink, and its movement mimics a still-improving changeup, while McMahon's slider remains his go-to finishing pitch. For how violent his delivery is, McMahon fills the zone with his fastball and is pretty good at locating his slider consistently to his glove side, although not always in a precise, enticing location. He often appears to be ""underneath"" his changeup, and creates lateral action on it but inconsistent dive; sometimes he actually gets impact dive on the change when he releases it late and it ends up glove-side. Yes, he's had some injury issues (knee tendinitis in 2018, shoulder soreness in '19) but McMahon has No. 4/5 starter stuff with a chance for more if the change keeps coming. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3014429"

The physical tools were obvious, and pretty similar to what Dodgers prospect D.J. Peters looked like coming out of junior college, there was just no way of knowing how Doyle would handle a huge leap in opposing pitcher quality. He is built like an old school, run-stopping strong safety at a physical 6-foot-3, 220 pounds. He runs well, has plus raw power, and after the 2019 draft, against the best pitching he'd ever faced in his life, Doyle hit .383/.477/.611 in the Pioneer League. Some of that is due to the league's hitting environment, but his physical ability was evident even on a field with other pro athletes, and his ball/strike recognition and ability to spoil pitchers' pitches were much better than anticipated considering how few quality arms he had seen to that point. Two scouts who saw Rockies instructs mentioned that they'll be curious to see how he deals with upper-level breaking stuff but think he can hit velo, hit it with power without compromising contact, and play center field.  <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3009965"

It's his lateral quickness that's an issue, and why he's generally considered a first base prospect. But same as we've seen Travis Shaw and Max Muncy play elsewhere, it stands to reason someone out there thinks Welker can stay at third, or handle duties around the second base bag in certain situations. Those are the teams most likely to think he can play something resembling an everyday role, because while he has excellent feel to hit, he lacks the raw power typical of first base. Though he's not especially athletic, Welker's swing is. He's a loose rotator with a well-balanced, long, slow leg kick and he's really great at diving and hitting pitches away from him the other way. He stays inside the baseball and works center and right/center field most of the time, only really turning on hanging breaking balls with pull power. I like his bat enough to consider him a role-playing corner bat but the power/defensive spectrum shortcomings leave him short of a more regular role. <em>(Alternate site)</em>",,"sa917962"

For a switch-hitter this young, Amador already has fairly advanced feel to hit in games, even if the swings aren't always pretty. He's medium-framed and likely to grow into some more power, but probably not a ton. He's graceful and athletic enough that I also consider him likely to stay on the middle infield, though I'm not sure if it'll be at second base or shortstop.

There's arguably too much velocity separation between the heater and curveball for the latter to be effective right now, but it has bat-missing depth and shape. Similar to his presently poor feel for location, Olivarez lacks changeup feel. Many things -- holding the velo deep into games, mechanical consistency, a sharper curveball, a much better changeup -- need to progress for Olivarez to attain what appears to be massive potential when you consider his arm strength, frame, and proclivity for spin. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>","107F9pqncng","sa3002965"

That continued during Schunk's initial foray into pro ball but seemed to regress at the alt site and during instructs, where he really struggled to get around on fastballs on the inner half and either fouled off hittable pitches there or was jammed. It will be less important for Schunk to hit for big power if it turns out he can play second base, which he/Colorado began experimenting with in 2020. He's such an athletic third base defender that, having not yet seen him play second myself, I'd give him a fair chance of making it work, just on spec. I've left Schunk in the same FV tier as last year but slid him down among the other 40+ guys because of newfound concern with this hole on the inner half that needs closing. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3009957"

Then he was Colorado's best pitching prospect at instructs, where he was consistently sitting 95-97, up to 98, and working with a comfortably plus slider. He'll work the slider in on the hands of righties like a cutter, or bury it beneath the zone to finish hitters. Because Weatherly was in the bullpen as an underclassman, he's barely ever thrown a changeup, or any third pitch, and he only threw about a dozen changeups in all of 2020 at Clemson. Because his slider feel is so good, maybe this is the type of guy who should just have a second breaking ball rather than try to force feed him a changeup, which is what has worked for Germán Márquez. Weatherly carries relief risk related to his fastball command but he may also just be scratching the surface because of his relative inexperience.

He seemed to be moving past that in 2019, his first full pro season, when his walk rate was lower than it ever was in college and he showed more varied and sentient fastball usage. But Rolison's alt site and instructs looks were more like during college. His fastball command was pretty loose (typically later in outings) and his below-average changeup missed in the zone an awful lot, forcing Rolison to lean on his curveball a ton (it's his best first-strike pitch and most consistent putaway pitch). Heuristically, I want to bet on a lefty with such a good breaking ball, but if Rolison can't command his fastball then hitters will just sit on that curveball, which opposing college lineups seemed to be doing in his worst D-I outings. Scouts came away from instructs thinking he had a lot of relief risk and Rolison's heater has been in the 90-92 range this spring. The chance for a rebound, and that Rolison might experience a velo bump if he were put in the bullpen, means he should still be in an impact FV tier, but he's trending more and more like a fifth starter. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em> ","ayEAfzM9lDo","sa3008244"

Though he's come out to start 2021 more in the 93-95 range, Gilbreath's heater has many of the other characteristics of a bat-missing fastball and it will still be an effective pitch if he lives in that range. This is the arm du jour, backspinning, flat-angled fastball that power pitchers use at the letters. His slider feel has been less consistent but that's a power, mid-80s breaking ball when it's located right. If his slider location consistency improves then Gilbreath can be a high-leverage reliever.

A lot of his swings were awkward, but he was short to the ball and showed big bat speed on his confident cuts, then at other times would make mid-flight adjustments to breaking balls. I also had him home-to-first in the 4.20-4.25 range a couple of times, and thought he might fill out the way Cubs SS/3B Chris Morel has and grow into some pop, with fingers crossed that the timing/feel aspects of hitting materialized with reps.

His approach, however, is a problem. During some of his Fall League starts, Montero saw five pitches over the course of an entire game. During the regular season, he averaged just shy of 2.5 pitches per plate appearance. For comparison's sake, among big league hitters with at least 200 PAs in 2019, Willians Astudillo ranked last in pitchers per PA with 2.9; no other big leaguer was under three. From a hitting talent perspective -- the bat speed, primarily -- Montero has everyday upside, so he belongs ranked ahead of prospects who project to be lesser role players at best.

His plus curveball is almost indistinguishable from the fastball for most of its flight and Goudeau would also command that with precision. In 2020, that command consistency and Goudeau's slider both disappeared, the Rockies waived him, and Goudeau hopped around on waivers during the offseason before landing with the Orioles, who plan to stretch him out as a starter during camp and reintroduce the slider. He's a bounce-back candidate who I liked as an ultra-consistent middle relief option. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>","0B5NQkdVsCk","15139"

In his brief 2020 big league debut, he was 92-95. Santos' long arm action and inconsistent secondary stuff push him toward the bullpen. He throws an awful lot of pitches (four- and two-seamers, a slider, changeup, an occasional curve), all of which are average. I think the violent deception enables a low-leverage relief role. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>",,"20383"

He gave up a homer to Luis Matos, but then sat 97-98, and had a plus-plus slider and an average changeup. During his next two outings, he sat 91-95 with zero feel for locating his fastball and was left to throw an awful lot of pitches to get himself out of trouble. At one point he threw three consecutive wild pitches and the scout section was yelling toward the Rockies dugout to roll the inning. Injuries (oblique, forearm, shoulder) and wildness have made it difficult for Pint to develop at all.

Now 24, Eusebio is officially behind, but his stuff was only down a bit beneath it's usual level when he pitched late during the 2019 summer, so there's still a shot this guy breaks out and gets pushed quickly, especially if he just gets 'penned. <em>(At-home dev)</em>","_6e6_k8YR2U","sa828552"
