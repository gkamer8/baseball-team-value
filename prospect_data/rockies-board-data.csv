"Brendan Rodgers","COL","2B","MLB",31,1,,"55",2020,,"23.9305555","6' 0""","180","R","R",2015,"Draft","COL",5500000,"Lake Mary HS (FL)","If you google ""Brendan Rodgers,"" the first several results are for Leicester City's soccer coach, who has been managing Premier League teams since 2008. Baseball's Brendan Rodgers has been known to scouts for about that long, and has been hitting the entire time. Even as an underclassman, Rodgers was often the best player on the field at well-attended showcase events; when he was a high school junior, scouts thought that if you were to drop him in the draft a year early, he'd still go somewhere in the first round. By his pre-draft summer, Rodgers clearly had the best hit and power combination among his peers, and looked likely to stay on the middle infield. He was the early favorite to go first overall in 2015 until Dansby Swanson, Alex Bregman, and Andrew Benintendi took a leap the following spring, allowing the Rockies to get him third overall. 
One axiom to which we try to adhere is ""good hitters hit all the time"" and that is indeed what Rodgers has done for the last eight years. He's a career .293/.348/.491 hitter in the minors, and while most of Colorado's affiliates play in hitter-friendly parks -- this fact has masked some of Rodgers' mediocre pitch recognition -- we anticipate he'll continue to be a plus hitter in the big leagues. His initial major league trial -- a rough 25-game jaunt in the early summer -- was not especially encouraging. Rodgers hit .224, swung and missed twice as often as he had in Triple-A (8% swinging strike rate in the minors, 15% in the majors), and generally appeared overwhelmed. But an 80 plate appearance sample doesn't usurp Rodgers' lengthy track record of hitting. In November, Rodgers told the <em>Denver Post</em> that he had been dealing with ""nagging"" shoulder issues since 2018 before deciding to have labrum surgery in June of 2019. As of mid-November, he had yet to begin throwing and hitting. Because he's only a fringe runner and athlete, Rodgers' conditioning during rehab is pretty important. A heavy, lumbering Rodgers who needs to play third base is swimming upstream against a 105 wRC+ at the position, while a Rodgers capable of playing second has a 94 wRC+ bar to clear.","8R3NqST3CPs","17907"

His in-the-box actions are quiet and smooth up until the moment he decides to unleash hell on the baseball. He can clear his hips and crush balls in and he can also extends his arms and crush pitches away from him to the opposite field gap. Because of the frame-based power potential, Veen was one of the handful of high schoolers who had a chance to really blow up during his senior spring and insert himself among the college prospects atop this draft, and because high school ball began in Florida before the COVID-19 outbreak, teams got to see some of that development and Veen separated himself from the other prep outfielders more clearly.

As a draft-eligible sophomore, he came out of the chute blazing hot and had top-10 pick buzz for the first month of the season before his year descended into chaos. He became wild and predictable, and yes, you read that right. Rolison couldn't throw strikes with his fastball and leaned heavily on his curveball, which opposing hitters anticipated and crushed. It led to some bad outings, including one at South Carolina where he allowed 11 runs. 
But 2019 was different. Rolison not only threw a greater percentage of strikes (65%) but he located his four-seam fastball where it plays best -- at the top of the zone. After holding his college velo early in the year, it dipped late in the season but still competes for swings and misses because of its ride. There's also more coherent pitch usage and a better pitch mix now; Rolison has a two-seamer, threw more changeups last year, and was just generally more mechanically consistent. He still throws across his body a bit and it can be hard for him to locate his breaking ball to his glove side, but the raw material for a lefty with three above-average pitches and starter control/command is clearly here and coming fast, so this is a back of the 50 FV tier prospect.","ayEAfzM9lDo","sa3008244"

He simply could not time his previous cut and was late on many pitches, pushing them the other way or into the ground. The tweak brought his groundball rate closer to average (50% previously, down to 42% in 2019) and more than doubled his home run output from the prior year. 
It's necessary progress for a player who began a long-anticipated fall down the defensive spectrum, and will likely continue to do so. Vilade began seeing time at third base in 2019, and was taking reps in the outfield during the Rockies' fall workouts. He looked noticeably bigger and stronger on the Salt River backfields than he did during the summer, and we now anticipate Vilade will branch out and play both outfield and infield corners, which makes sense considering how entrenched Nolan Arenado is at third base. Is the tumble troubling? Somewhat, but it's counterbalanced by versatility, and it's encouraging that Vilade has now shown an ability to make relevant swing adjustments to get to his power. This is a rather magmatic prospect currently transitioning in several ways, but they're generally positive.",,"sa3004256"

He was hitting .207 when PAC-12 play began and his draft stock had taken a plunge but for whatever reason, he started raking during conference play. By the end of the year, he was hitting .315 and had reached base in 29 straight games. Toglia has a rare combination of traits and skills. He's a switch-hitting first baseman with power who is also a plus defender, which puts him in a small, 21st century team picture with Lance Berkman, Mark Teixeira, and Carlos Santana. That's an intriguing group. We think teams hopped off of Toglia too quickly because of bad early-season looks and that he might be poised for a breakout 2020.",,"sa3010393"

He was raw, and the relative lack of track record likely contributed to him lasting until the 15th round of his junior season, but for a player with this much physical ability to fall that far is a failure on the part of the amateur side of the industry. 
Hilliard is a big, athletic thumper with a rare power/speed combination. He's flourished in his four years as a full-time hitter, slashing .277/.350/.480 in the minors before reaching the big leagues late last summer. As one might expect for such an under-baked athlete who a) barely played as a junior college freshman and b) also pitched the next two years, Hilliard lacks defensive instincts and feel to hit. His ability to identify pitches he can drive is impressive in context, but well-executed pitches can get him out. Hilliard's big, gallivanting strides make him a plus runner underway, but his mediocre reads on balls in center detract from his range. It's still above-average in a corner, closer to fringe in center field. It's kind of a tweener defensive profile except with way more raw power than is usual for that sort, so Hilliard projects to be a strong big league role player, likely the larger half of a platoon in any of the three outfield positions.",,"17954"

He's a patient hitter with an athletic swing who gets the most out of his slight build without often compromising his feel for contact. His swing is kind of grooved, but Vavra is a pitch selection savant, adept at picking out pitches he can drive until he has to expand with two strikes. We think he's going to hit, have doubles power, and reach base at an above-average clip. That could play every day at shortstop, but we think Vavra is much more likely to end up at second base, where his range could make him an above-average defender. There's not enough power for an impact regular here, but the athleticism and feel for contact should make Vavra either a low-end regular on the middle infield or a valuable, multi-positional role player.",,"sa3007643"

It's his lateral quickness that's an issue, and why he's generally considered a first base prospect. But same as we've seen Travis Shaw and Max Muncy play elsewhere, it stands to reason someone out there thinks Welker can stay at third, or handle duties around the second base bag in certain situations. Those are the teams most likely to think Welker can play something resembling an everyday role, because while he has excellent feel to hit, he lacks the raw power typical of first base.",,"sa917962"

After two years of struggling to get to his raw power in games (he hit just four homers combined his freshman and sophomore seasons), Schunk had a breakout junior year and clubbed 15 dingers. We were hoping he'd start pulling and lifting the ball more and he did, both at Georgia and during his first pro summer. He's an athletic gamer who's a good defender at third, though because of the arm strength there was some speculative projecting while Schunk was an amateur that he might catch.

The physical tools were obvious and pretty similar to what Dodgers prospect D.J. Peters looked like coming out of junior college. Doyle is built like an old school, run-stopping safety at a physical 6-foot-3, 220 pounds. He runs well, has power, and after the draft, against the best pitching he ever faced in his life, Doyle mashed. His ball/strike recognition and ability to spoil pitchers' pitches were much better than we would have anticipated considering how few quality arms he had seen to that point.

Pitchers who walk guys at even a 10% or worse clip face legitimate questions about their ability to start, and sometimes their ability to pitch in the big leagues at all. Pint walked more than 30% of the hitters he faced last year, and had more wild pitches than innings. Such strike-throwing incompetence forced a move to the bullpen, which siphoned away reps, and injuries (oblique, forearm, shoulder) over the last two years have exacerbated this issue. He simply can't be a big leaguer with this kind of wildness, but we're still on Pint because his stuff remains incredible, among the best in the minors. 
Through these struggles, Pint has continued to throw in the upper-90s with one of the harder power curveballs on the planet. The chances that he ends up as part of a rotation in any capacity have shrunk considerably, but there's still a fair shot that he becomes a high-leverage reliever.","SHwmwNMieek","sa917922"

For a switch-hitter this young, Amador already has fairly advanced feel to hit in games, even if the swings aren't always pretty. He's medium-framed and likely to grow into some more power, but probably not a ton. He's graceful and athletic enough that we also consider him likely to stay on the middle infield, though we're not sure if it'll be at second base or shortstop.

He does have tremendous stuff for his age, already sitting in the mid-90s early during his starts and flashing a plus curveball. There's arguably too much velocity separation between the heater and curveball for the latter to be effective right now, but it has bat-missing depth and shape. Similar to his presently poor feel for location, Olivarez lacks changeup feel. Many things -- holding the velo deep into games, mechanical consistency, a sharper curveball, a much better changeup -- need to progress for Olivarez to attain what appears to be massive potential when you see his arm strength, frame, and proclivity for spin.","107F9pqncng","sa3002965"

Goudeau epitomizes fastball spin efficiency, creating near perfect backspin and seam uniformity on his heater, giving it bat-missing carry at the top of the strike zone. His plus curveball is almost indistinguishable from the fastball for most of its flight. Those two pitches together would suffice to make Goudeau an effective middle reliever, but if he retains this abrupt, extreme strike-throwing ability, then perhaps he can go multiple innings. It's rare for four-seam/curveball guys to succeed in Denver, though.","0B5NQkdVsCk","sa658634"

His swing has leverage and real bat speed already, and his wiry frame portends more, and though his bat path and stride are both kind of a mess, Carreras' hand-eye coordination and bat control enabled him to succeed against mostly college-level pitching last year at age 19. He's a plus runner and athletic infield defender who will probably only fit at third base once he's done filling out.

He tracks pitches beautifully and can make quality contact with pitches all over the zone, but it's very tough for a righty-hitting first baseman without big power to profile. Nevin's reps at third base have dwindled, and he played a few games in left field last summer. He's on the 40-man and looks like a corner bench bat.",,"sa874752"

Lavigne has not shown that kind of power with the wooden bats in pro ball, both because he's not hitting the ball as hard as we anticipated and because he isn't lifting it. Were Lavigne as physically projectable as his age suggests, this would be less worrisome, but he's a broad-shouldered, imposing presence, so the lack of present thump is somewhat troubling.
