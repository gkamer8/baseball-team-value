"Matt Manning","DET","RHP",,12,1,,"60",2021,,"22.4611111","6' 6""","215","R","R",2016,"Draft","DET",3505800,"Sheldon HS (CA)","If you get déjà vu reading this report it's because Manning has become the dream. All of the physical components that many front-end arms have while they're in high school were there when he was an amateur -- shooting guard frame, premium arm strength and athleticism, a breaking ball -- the stuff that enables your imagination to run wild. And Manning succeeded while devoting time to two sports, which caused him to get a late start during his draft spring because the hoops team was in the middle of a deep playoff run (Manning threw late into the prior summer, so this may have actually been good for limiting innings). 
After some initial strike-throwing issues and a change in stride direction, the REM cycle arrived. The walks came down, Manning's changeup got better, and he started working with two different fastballs and was clearly manipulating the shape of his spike curveball depending on the hitter and situation. He's never had arm issues (his 2018 IL stint was due to an oblique injury), and he has rare on-mound athleticism coupled with an understanding of how to pitch. He's going to have three out-pitches thanks to adjustments he's already made, and it's fair to assume he'll be able to make more. Manning is tracking like an All-Star starter and a potential top-of-the-rotation arm.","k-sipbEctAU","sa917924"
"Casey Mize","DET","RHP",,16,2,,"60",2020,,"23.2027777","6' 3""","208","R","R",2018,"Draft","DET",7500000,"Auburn","We would not have guessed that, at this stage, the two-sport prep pitching prospect in this system would have lower perceived variance than the dominant SEC arm who went first in his draft class, but here we are. Mize has hellacious stuff. His four-pitch mix has actually gotten better since college because he and the Tigers successfully added greater demarcation between his cutter and slider, the latter of which now has more two-plane sweep. His entire repertoire is capable of missing bats, like Manning's, but Mize's split is superior to Manning's change and he has an additional weapon, the cutter, that Manning does not. 
So why ever-so-slightly prefer Manning? Mize's injury track record is as scary as his stuff. Some teams had concerns about his shoulder when he was a draft-eligible high schooler, he had elbow issues as a sophomore at Auburn, he had a PRP injection after he pitched for Team USA the summer before his draft year, and in 2019, he missed a month with a shoulder injury. After Mize returned, he had some outings where his fastball was in the 90-92 range, he used his splitter less frequently, and when he did use it, it had more spin than usual. It's speculation, but perhaps he was tinkering with changeup grips after the injury. That's an awful lot of smoke. Purely on quality of stuff, Mize is arguably the top pitching prospect in all of baseball. We still love him and think it's perfectly reasonable to consider him the top youngster in this system and one of the best on the planet, but what Manning has become, what he might continue to develop into based on his athleticism and now-evident ability to make adjustments, combined with his much, much cleaner bill of health, shades him ahead of Mize, in our (mostly Eric's) opinion, within the same FV tier.","KTLpXoKizJU","sa3008444"

After he hit a combined .336/.445/.722 as a freshman and sophomore, Tork was off to a ridiculous .340/.598/.780 start as a junior and was leading the country in walks. He has sublime hitter's timing, plus bat speed, and above-average barrel control and ball/strike recognition, really only struggling with breaking balls located beneath the zone, which may be easy to remedy with a slightly longer stride. Tork only fits as a 1B, as he body comps to Yankees 1B Luke Voit. It's a tough profile, but his track record and tools, which are very similar to Andrew Vaughn's, are sufficient to generate confidence and top-of-the-draft enthusiasm anyway. Torkelson is probably going to move very quickly through the minors and be a thumping, heart of the order hitter.","3Q4wD3EV960",

During his pre-draft summer, Greene was a little soft-bodied, his running gait was odd, and he seemed destined to play little more than an average outfield corner. The player scouts watched the following spring had a better physical composition, was more explosive and a better runner, and had as ripe a high school hit tool as was available in the draft. This was similar to how Jarred Kelenic's skills were colored as he came out of high school. 
Greene's swing, curated by his father from an early age, is beautiful. He can clear his hips and turn on just about anything on the inner half, drop the bat head and lift balls with power, strike balls the other way with authority, and he tracked and whacked many high school benders. The bend and flexion in Greene's front knee as his swing clears the point of impact is reminiscent of several Dodger hitters. Though there are many examples of Greene having certain types of athleticism (he is a tremendous leaper, for instance), he's not a runner and we don't have him in center field. But we think he'll hit enough that it doesn't matter.",,"sa3010694"
"Tarik Skubal","DET","LHP","AA",56,5,,"50",2021,,"23.65","6' 3""","215","L","L",2018,"Draft","DET",350000,"Seattle","Skubal was rehabbing from Tommy John during his junior year at Seattle University and only managed to throw a few bullpen sessions in front of scouts before the 2017 draft. Scouts liked what they saw, but not enough to meet a price tag that was up around $1 million according to sources. Skubal went back to school and was horrendous early in the year before he slowly began to throw more and more strikes. Now 29 teams and their evaluators are cursing themselves for either failing to notice that upward trend throughout the 2018 spring, or for noticing but lacking conviction in the draft room. 
There are some folks in baseball who have Skubal right up in the same tier with Mize and Manning. He has a dominant fastball, equal parts velocity, ride, and tough-to-square angle. So unhittable is Skubal's heater that he's struck out 37% of hitters during his pro career (48% over the final few weeks over Double-A play last year) while throwing the pitch roughly 70% of the time. No current big leaguer with a fastball that plays at the top of the zone throws their fastball that much; anyone close to 70% is a sinkerballer. An occasionally good changeup and slider aside, Skubal's secondaries are not all that great in a vacuum, but luckily they too benefit from the funky angle created by Skubal's cross-bodied, high-slot delivery. His overall swinging strike rate (18%) was higher than the rate on his fastball alone (15%), which means the secondaries were a net positive for him, but we're unsure of what big league hitters will do if they know a fastball aimed at the letters is coming most of the time. So while he's had nothing but goofy strikeout rates for two years, we think Skubal ends up more toward the middle of a rotation rather than the front.","bcoy-xb3kJY","sa3007593"

A lack of in-game power and/or defensive excellence, combined with the abnormally high bar to clear at third base right now, may overshadow Paredes' short-term impact in a league-wide context. Body-related concerns about his athletic longevity pinch what we think he'll do in his late 20s. Paredes should hit enough to be an average everday player, like Luis Arraez except on a corner.","f5iDesF-nuc","sa920275"

Much of his velocity was back in 2019. He's still searching for a consistent changeup, one with a little more velocity separation than it currently has, but Faedo's slider and slider command give him an out-pitch.

In 2018, Wentz had shoulder and oblique issues and his stuff played closer to average; in 2019 he was a bit healthier and better.

Unless Perez grows into better quality contact, be it physically, mechanically, or both, he may become one of the several quality prospects who get exposed in the Rule 5 every year because the parent club thinks they're too raw for other teams to bite. Red Sox 2019 Rule 5 pick, Jonathan Arauz, is a similar player.

He still had 40 extra-base hits, and Cameron's all-fields power (he doesn't have huge raw, but he does have wall-scraping pop to center and right center because the swing has some inside out elements) and selectivity give him the ability to do some slugging damage and reach base amid all the whiffing. Daz has been a known prospect for seven or eight years now. He's got great body control but isn't especially toolsy, and his instincts and baseball acumen play a large role in his defensive ability and baserunning.

A polished strike-thrower with four good pitches, he reached Double-A as a 19-year-old back in 2017 before he became the centerpiece of the Justin Verlander deal. Advanced though he was, various injuries have robbed Perez of innings. In 2016, he had knee trouble; in 2018, it was a lat strain, then shoulder inflammation. An ominous trap issue popped up during the early parts of 2019 spring training but Perez was back on the mound quickly and sitting his usual 93-96 into late-March, before he had three IL stints -- in April, May, and June -- and was shut down for the year. 
He has yet to throw more than 86 frames in an entire season, so while he may be fairly advanced for someone his age, and definitely for someone who has pitched so little, the industry has yet to see his stuff hold up for a whole summer of starter's innings.

Zimmer and the younger Meadows both have deceptively easy plus speed due to their long frames, and each has a plus arm and plus raw power; Christian Yelich is the advanced hitter version of this profile. But as a high schooler, Meadows' main concern was tied to contact issues caused by his long limbs and lack of rhythm at the plate.

He sits 91-94 and touches 95 with pretty significant fastball spin for that velo range — about 2400 rpm on average — but because Garcia has a lower arm slot, the pitch doesn’t have the kind of lift that would miss bats. The arm slot and Garcia’s above-average, two-plane breaking ball make him especially tough on righties, who he held to a .197/.273/.356 line in 2019. The changeup needs to get better if Garcia is going to continue to start, but Detroit is becoming quite good at implementing coherent pitch design, so maybe it will, or perhaps the Tigers will find a way to give him a relevant second breaking ball.",,"sa918036"

Alcantara has a laser arm, he can run, he's a good defensive shortstop, and he even has above-average ball/strike recognition. But the quality of contact is arguably insufficient for even a utility role. He's nearly out of option years. We wonder if reps in center might enable a 26th man sort of role, but also think it's possible the Tigers give a conversion to the mound a shot since Detroit is getting better at developing pitchers, including a few interesting conversion arms.",,"sa739641"
