Indeed, after he hit a combined .336/.445/.722 as a freshman and sophomore, Tork was off to a ridiculous .340/.598/.780 start to his final college season, and was leading the country in walks as opposing pitchers began to fearfully dump in more and more breaking balls against him. As the draft approached, he began to swing over the top of those breaking balls more than usual, which might have been because either he was pressing due to the looming draft, or because of the lack of an impact sidekick in ASU's lineup since Hunter Bishop was no longer hitting behind him. Torkelson has sublime hitter's timing, plus bat speed, and above-average barrel control and ball/strike recognition, really only struggling with those breaking balls located beneath the zone, which may be easy to remedy with a slightly longer stride to create more barrel depth. The Tigers announced him as a third baseman, and it makes sense for them to explore if he can be even a 35- or 40-grade defender there. He's been surprisingly acceptable at third this spring, but with body comps to Yankees first baseman Luke Voit, it's going to be a struggle to stick there. It's a tough profile, but his elite statistical track record and the visual evaluation of Torkelson's hitting acumen align and serve to generate confidence that he'll be a thumping, heart of the order hitter. And Detroit will probably allow him to move quickly since so much of their young pitching is now arriving in the big leagues. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>","3Q4wD3EV960","sa3014504"
"Matt Manning","DET","SP","AAA",17,2,,"60",2021,"High","23.3527777","6' 6""","215","R","R",2016,"Draft","DET",3505800,"Sheldon HS (CA)","A large part of the reason Manning ranked first on last year's Tigers list was because he had neither Casey Mize's injury red flags nor Tarik Skubal's relief risk. Then in late August, he was shut down with a forearm strain, the first real blemish on what had been an immaculate track record of arm health (his 2018 IL stint was due to an oblique injury). Manning has publicly downplayed the severity of that injury and has been healthy and throwing all offseason without issue. We'd rather he have been totally healthy, but this injury doesn't seem severe enough to alter his stock. 
All of the physical components that many front-end arms have while they're in high school were present when Manning was an amateur -- shooting guard frame, premium arm strength and athleticism, a breaking ball -- and remain so today. He has pretty good feel for location and balance for a young 6-foot-6 guy who takes such a gargantuan stride off the mound, and that should continue improving with time and reps. Manning starts on the extreme first base side of the rubber and has a cross-bodied, drop-and-drive style delivery that creates flat angle on his fastball, which gets on hitters quickly. And Manning goes right at hitters with that fastball (60% in-zone rate in 2019), which has the cut/carry traits typical of a power pitcher's fastball. His arm slot is much different now than it was in high school, a testament to Detroit's dev group and Manning's ability to make adjustments without a drop off in on-field performance. Since entering pro ball, his walks have come down, Manning's changeup has gotten better, and he started working with two different fastballs and was clearly manipulating the shape of his spike curveball depending on the hitter and situation in 2019. Now he's working on a second breaking ball. Assuming the forearm issues are behind him, Manning has front-end starter ceiling and will likely make his big league debut in 2021. <em>(Alternate site)</em>","k-sipbEctAU","sa917924"
"Tarik Skubal","DET","SP","MLB",21,3,,"60",2021,"High","24.5416666","6' 3""","215","L","L",2018,"Draft","DET",350000,"Seattle","Skubal had recovered enough from Tommy John to throw a few bullpens for scouts toward the end of his junior year, but his camp thought he could do better than what was being offered, so he returned to school for his redshirt junior year. He was horrendous early the next season before he slowly began to throw more and more strikes as the draft approached. He's dominated opposing hitters since signing, amassing 212 strikeouts in 145 minor league innings before his 2020 big league debut. Until he set foot in the big leagues, Skubal had some relief risk because he was working with his fastball at a bizarre rate in the minors. His delivery looks like a pterodactyl is trying to throw a baseball, and it forces hitters to deal with a very strange look and angle, as well as big velocity and carry at the top of the zone. So unhittable is Skubal's heater that he's struck out 37% of hitters during his minor league career (48% over the final few weeks over Double-A play in 2019) while throwing the pitch roughly 70% of the time. No current big leaguer with a fastball that plays at the top of the zone throws their fastball that much, and anyone close to 70% is a sinkerballer. 
During his initial 2020 big league trial, Skubal was quite wild early on but, just as in his draft year, he slowly started to work more efficiently toward the end of the summer. His changeup (which has lateral action but almost no sink, which is sort of bizarre) and slider are now clearly his best non-fastball weapons, though he can only reliably throw the fastball for strikes. In addition to some of the visual command problems, Skubal's release point is highly variable. Because he has such a nasty mix of stuff, and because he has shown a slow, but relevant command progression in the past and seems to be doing it again, we're still inclined to project Skubal as a mid-rotation starter rather than the highest-ranked reliever on this list. He'll generate amazing rate stats early in his career but probably won't work deep into games, but he has top-of-the-rotation ceiling if he can develop better command. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>","bcoy-xb3kJY","22267"

But we're sufficiently scared of Mize's injury history (a strain that required a PRP injection in college, shoulder inflammation in 2019) to slide him behind players of a similar talent. If he stays healthy, then he'll be a (WAR-based) No. 2 starter, capable of pitching at the top of a contender's rotation, and likely have dominant stretches over the next half decade. Mize's fastball doesn't have bat-missing carry but when he's totally healthy, it's hard and he locates it as well as his plus-plus splitter. We don't think his upper-80s ""slider"" has the length to miss bats and instead think it'll eventually be used to induce weak contact rather than as a putaway pitch. His curveball, which Mize has better demarcated from his ""slider"" since entering pro ball, might emerge as the finishing weapon. There remains a large swath of the industry that is fearful of cutter/splitter guys, and we don't know if that's justified but it certainly impacts how teams internally line up the Tigers prospects. What we do think is that players who have been hurt in the past are the ones most likely to get hurt again, and while we know it's begun to feel like every pitcher gets hurt at some point, there's more smoke here than in most other cases. We have a Masahiro Tanaka comp on Mize. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>","KTLpXoKizJU","20492"

During his pre-draft summer, Greene was a little soft-bodied, his running gait was odd, and he seemed destined to play little more than an average outfield corner. The player scouts watched the following spring had a better physical composition, was more explosive and a better runner, and had as ripe a high school hit tool as was available in the draft. This was similar to how Jarred Kelenic's skills were colored as he came out of high school. 
Greene's swing, curated by his father from an early age, is beautiful. He can clear his hips and turn on just about anything on the inner half, drop the bat head and lift balls with power, strike balls the other way with authority, and he tracked and whacked many high school benders. The bend and flexion in Greene's front knee as his swing clears the point of impact is reminiscent of several Dodgers hitters. Though there are many examples of Greene having certain types of athleticism (he is a tremendous leaper, for instance), he's not a runner and we don't have him projected in center field. But we think he'll hit enough that it doesn't matter. Though he started a string of high-upside early 20-somethings on this year's top 100, his skills are more comparable to those of the polished college draftees in their mid-20s who are slightly ahead of him there because they're further up the minor league ladder. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3010694"

Catchers tend to go early in the draft, and the Tigers were surprised to see him still on the board with the first pick of the second round; they quickly signed him to the slot-recommended bonus of just under $2 million. 
Dingler checks a lot of boxes scouts look for in future big league catchers, combining size and strength with above-average athleticism for the position. He has a decent approach and solid hand-eye coordination, and some scouts see average or better power developing in the future after he hit five home runs in 13 games last spring; he entered the year having notched just seven over 102 games as a freshman and sophomore with the Buckeyes. Setting up with a slightly closed stance, Dingler’s swing can get a bit lengthy and uphill, leaving him susceptible to balls in the upper half of the zone, but he nonetheless projects as an above-average offensive contributor for the position. He needs to work on some of the physical intricacies of catching, but arrives to pro ball with all of the intangibles in terms of leadership and game management. His arm is plus, with consistent sub-2.00 pop times, but he can take some time to unfold his big frame and let it fly. Spending time with the big league club this spring, Dingler has a chance to move quickly and has taken the mantle as Detroit’s catcher of the future. <em>(Alternate site)</em>",,"sa3014528"

Parker was also seen as having a larger gap between his tools and skills, which dropped him to the second round, and the rawness in his game was evident during his full-season debut. Meadows is an eye-catching athlete with tremendous upside. He’s starting to fill into his 6-foot-5 frame but remains a plus runner with above-average power potential. His arm is a third plus tool and while he has some experience in center, most feel right field is his future position, and he has a chance to impact the game in a corner spot. The biggest question for scouts is just how much Meadows is going to hit. He’s exceptionally noisy pre-swing, with a big bat waggle while bouncing on his front foot, and his swing initiates in the wrong direction, creating significant bat wrap. There’s plenty of bat speed on display, which, along with a solid approach, gives him some foundation for future success provided there are mechanical adjustments. This is a player with a very wide range of potential outcomes. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3007943"

Then Paredes went to Mexico, where he has spent each of the last three offseasons, and as usual was the best hitter in the entire Pacific League. He's quite comfortable in the box, and shows balance throughout his swing and fantastic hand-eye coordination. Playing winter ball has helped Paredes keep his high-maintenance build in check and it's better now than it was when he was in the low minors with the Cubs. He's just not a very good athlete or defender and doesn't have the thump typical of a corner infielder who can't field well. There aren't many contact-only third basemen in the game, and this, along with concerns about his athletic longevity, caused us to slide Paredes out of the back of the Top 100.

Let's recall how he got here: Wentz was a two-way high schooler who spent his entire pre-draft summer as a position player while he rested his arm. His pre-draft spring was uneven but his velocity climbed as selection day approached, and he was 92-95 in a few outings just before the draft. Injuries (shoulder and oblique issues in 2018, then the TJ) and fluctuations in velocity (sometimes 91-93, sometimes 87-91) mixed with continued refinement of his secondary stuff. In addition to the overhand curveball he had in high school, Wentz has developed a fantastic changeup and it's become his best secondary pitch. So long as his velocity returns to normal, Wentz's fastball should play, as it has backspin and carry. The Tigers also seem to be pretty good at optimizing pitches and Wentz has only made a handful of starts in this org since being acquired for Shane Greene, so perhaps during rehab something about his breaking ball will change or tighten. To simply return to pre-injury form would put Wentz in the No. 4/5 starter range. <em>(TJ rehab)</em>","qGBi5_ZAt5c","sa917946"

After several down years, Lange's 2019 velocity was back to what it was during his best days at LSU, and his strikeout rate spiked after the Tigers, who got him as part of the Nick Castellanos return from the Cubs, moved him to the bullpen. He's throwing even harder this year. After sitting 91-93 and touching 95 in 2019, he was consistently 93-95 during 2020 instructs and has been 95-97 during spring training this year. Our high speed footage shows Lange throwing two different breaking balls, though their movement is hard to distinguish in real time because they both have big vertical depth.

Keith offers an intriguing combination of size, strength and athleticism. He’s an average runner despite his big frame and his mechanically sound swing produces consistent hard contact. A shortstop in high school, he'll slide over to third base as a pro, and while his actions and glove work need some tightening up, he projects as average at the hot corner with a well above-average arm that sat in the low-to-mid 90s on the mound. Keith is raw and needs considerable reps and instruction to reach his potential.

One of the best defensive catchers in recent drafts, Rogers was a key part of the 2017 Justin Verlander deal with Houston, and while he’s shined behind the plate and displayed some raw power, big questions about the bat remain. 
Any discussion of Rogers begins with his defense. He’s a quiet receiver with soft hands and he excels in the catcher intangibles with excellent game calling and on-field leadership. He’s gunned down nearly 50% of opposing base stealers as a pro, and while his arm strength is plus, it’s his accuracy that really stands out, with throws consistently on a line and on the bag. Overall, it’s a very valuable defensive package, but Rogers’ bat will ultimately define his playing time. While he has plus raw power, we has a well-below average hit tool thanks to a grooved swing that gives him little plate coverage and leads to plenty of swing-and-miss.

Richan is an extreme strike thrower, but he also has plus command. His fastball is only in the 90-92 range, but he can locate it and his average, low-80s slider, which serves as his primary secondary pitch. He can take a bit off the breaker for more of a pure curve, which he uses as an early strike stealer, and while his mid-80s changeup is a bit firm, it has decent fade. Richan can be guilty of too many strikes at times, offering too many drivable pitches when he’s ahead in the count. He doesn't have a weapon that plays well in the zone, so he'll need plus plus command to find any kind of consistency at the big league level.

He’s a long-levered righty who comes in and tries to miss bats with a traditional fastball/slider combination. While he lacks true smoke, he still can sit in the 94-96 range with his fastball, which features good life, and his velocity-driven low 80s slider has missed bats in the minors. It’s an arm-heavy delivery with little load or lower-half incorporation and a tick of violence, and it’s hard to see him ever being in possession of anything resembling above-average command.
