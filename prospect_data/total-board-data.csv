What does it take to draw such significant expectations? Let's first examine the statistical case. Franco has played 175 career games, all at levels well above what is typical for a player his age (he doesn't turn 19 until March). During those games, he's hit .336/.405/.523 with 71 extra-base hits, 20 steals, and more walks than strikeouts. In fact, across two levels in 2019, Low- and Hi-A, Franco not only walked more than he struck out, but walked about <em>twice</em> as much. He has one of the lowest swinging strike rates in the entire minor leagues, and it's possible the power hasn't fully actualized yet because Franco still hits the ball on the ground a lot (48% last year). How about the TrackMan data? Franco's exit velos and hard hit rate are both above big league average, which, again, is ridiculous for a teenager who's playing against competition four and a half years older than he is in the Florida State League. 
Of course, the visual baseball evaluation is also incredible. Franco had one of the best BP sessions at the Futures Game (his was better than Jo Adell, Nolan Jones, and everyone not named Royce Lewis) and the best infield. His hands are a powder keg, accelerating to the point where he can do huge damage, and he doesn't need mechanical length to get there. This is true from both sides of the plate; Franco can't be thwarted by turning him around and forcing him to hit from a weaker side. He might not ever produce big home run totals without a swing change, but it'd be ridiculous to alter this guy's swing considering how elite his performance has been. A scouting director once told me, ""Elite players are elite all the time,"" and that has been true of Franco since he was a young teen. He's been a force of nature offensively, he plays a premium defensive position very well, and my degree of confidence in his ability to do both in perpetuity is high because that's all Franco has ever done.","OsxMtDgMaI0","sa3007033"
"Gavin Lux","LAD","2B",,2,1,,"70",2020,,"22.675","6' 2""","190","L","R",2016,"Draft","LAD",2317000,"Indian Trail Academy HS (WI)","A highly entertaining example of the timeless ""you can't predict baseball"" maxim, in three years Lux has tranformed from a glove-first high school shortstop (there's a version of reality in which Lux, Bo Bichette, Hunter Bishop, <em>and</em> Spencer Torkelson are all on the same college team, though sadly, it's not this one) into a superstar offensive talent. If you want a visual example of ""twitch,"" watch Lux swing. His feet work slowly, and his right knee draws back toward his left hip like the string of a bow (different than his high school swing's footwork, which was more Sammy Sosa-ish, with ground contact in both directions) while he remains balanced and poised to strike. Then he strides forward, his hips clear, and his hands, which are looser and freer than they were as an amateur, ignite. Once Lux's hands get going, everything is over very quickly. He's tough to beat with even premium velocity but also identifies pitch types while they're in flight and can punish secondary stuff that catches too much of the zone. The other swing changes aside, Lux's bat path is relatively similar to what it was when he was a skinnier, gap-to-gap hitter with doubles power, except now he's very strong and balls are leaving the yard. He has pole-to-pole power and is going to get to it in games even though he's still a relatively low-launch angle hitter (nine degrees in the minors, 13 degrees in a small big league sample). 
What happens with Lux defensively is somewhat immaterial. He's publicly admitted to having the yips, which impacts the accuracy of his throws. Pure arm strength is not really an issue, but if he keeps one-hopping easy throws to first base, he might need to move off the infield. I have the arm graded as a 45 because of the accuracy issues and think there's some risk Lux needs to move to the outfield, but even if that's the case, I feel better about him hitting than all but one other prospect in all of the minors.","UN_FiRAXe4Q","19955"
"MacKenzie Gore","SDP","LHP",,3,1,,"70",2021,,"21.4222222","6' 3""","195","L","L",2017,"Draft","SDP",6700000,"Whiteville HS (NC)","The blisters that disrupted Gore's first full season in pro ball were not an issue in 2019, and he reached Double-A after 15 dominant starts in the hitter-friendly Cal League, during which he surrendered just nine measly runs. Gore pitches the same way a great horror movie villain lurks and ambushes from the shadows. The strange, balletic way he hoists his leading leg and hands as high as he can before he peddles home builds fear of the unknown, and dread anticipation the same way eerie music portends someone's cinematic demise. Then Gore lunges home with a huge stride, one that takes him slightly down the first base line, and gets right on top of hitters, creating more discomfort. Then, suddenly, the jump scare. The ball explodes out from behind Gore's head and blows past flailing hitters at the letters, banishing them to the dugout until their sequel at-bat a few innings later. 
Gore generated a 16% swinging strike rate overall last year and a 15% swinging strike rate on his fastball, which is amazing for a heater that only averaged 93 mph. Several other traits -- Gore generates nearly perfect backspin and seam uniformity on his fastballs, which you can see in the video that corresponds to this player capsule, and the flat approach angle of his stuff contributes, too -- help the fastball play up, including Gore's command which projects, at least, to plus. Spin efficiency also enables his curveball to be good even though it lacks big raw spin, he has glove-side command of his slider, and his changeups, though they're of mixed quality, are typically well-located. You can go wild projecting on Gore's secondary stuff, especially the changeup, and his command because he is such an exceptional athlete, and the fact that he can repeat and maintain such an odd and explosive delivery is clear evidence of that. 
The 2018 blister problems created some short-term workload issues that San Diego's dev group tried to solve by shutting Gore down for most of August. He threw side sessions for most of the month before returning for one last in-game outing before the Texas League playoffs, which he didn't pitch in. He had a 40-inning increase from 2018 to 2019, when he threw 100 frames. It puts him on pace to throw 120-140 innings this year, though it only makes sense for San Diego to push him if they're contending for the playoffs. Based on how they handled Paddack and Tatis last year, such an approach seems possible.","7bZP4Vs1QhA","sa3005068"
"Jo Adell","LAA","LF",,4,1,,"65",2021,,"21.3","6' 3""","215","R","R",2017,"Draft","LAA",4300000,"Ballard HS (KY)","The baseball-loving world held its collective breath last year when Adell went down with two freak leg injuries on the same spring training play (while going from first to third, he strained his left hamstring, then sprained his right ankle trying to stop himself when he felt the pull) and was shelved for a couple of months. While his gait appeared compromised during Extended spring rehab outings, Adell was asymptomatic throughout the summer and during the Arizona Fall League. After a brief jaunt in the Cal League, the Angels sent him to Double-A Mobile, where he'd had a strikeout-laden cup of coffee the year before. He adjusted, cut the strikeout rate down to a very livable 22%, and hit .308/.390/.553 over two months before he was sent to Triple-A in August. Again, Adell struck out a lot when he was challenged, and there are people in baseball who worry about how often he K's, but he was just 20 years old and has had success amid many swing changes since he signed, a common theme among Angels prospects. 
Adell's leg kick has been altered; he now raises it even with his waist at apex, and the height at which his hands load (as well as the angle of his bat when they do) was quite nomadic throughout last year. By the time Adell was done with Fall League and had joined Team USA's Premier12 Olympic qualifying efforts, he had a Gary Sheffield-style bat wrap. Adell is one of the best athletes in the minors (there's video of him box jumping 66 inches online) and the fact that's he's been able to manifest these adjustments on the field at will is incredible. Even if something mechanical isn't working in the future, chances are he'll be able to fix it. I've settled on projecting Adell in left field. The arm strength he showed as an amateur, when he was into the mid-90s as a pitcher, never totally returned after it mysteriously evaporated during his senior year of high school. He has a 40 arm and is such a hulking dude that he's just going to be a corner defender at maturity. Strikeouts may limit Adell's productivity when he's initially brought up, but I think eventually he'll be a middle-of-the-order force who hits 35-plus homers.","tpQIfgNoqIE","sa3004837"
"Adley Rutschman","BAL","C",,5,1,,"60",2021,,"22.4722222","6' 2""","216","S","R",2019,"Draft","BAL",8100000,"Oregon State","Rutschman is the total package, a physical monster who also has superlative baseball acumen and leadership qualities. From his sophomore season onward (and arguably starting in the fall before that) Rutschman went wire-to-wire as the top draft prospect in his class, a complete player and the best draft prospect in half a decade. His entire profile is ideal. It's rare for ambidextrous swingers to have polished swings from both sides of the plate, even moreso to have two nearly identical, rhythmic swings that produce power. 
It's more atypical still for that type of hitter to be a great defender at a premium position. Rutschman has a pickpocket's sleight of hand and absolutely cons umpires into calling strikes on the edge of the zone. Resolute umpires end up hearing it from biased fans who are easier marks. Aside from two instances, all of my Rustchman pop times over three years of looks are between 1.86 and 1.95 seconds, comfortably plus timed throws often right on the bag. Rutschman has the physical tools to become the best catcher in baseball, provided he stays healthy (he had some shoulder/back stuff in college). He's also an ultra-competitive, attentive, and vocal team leader who shepherds pitchers with measured, but intense encouragement. It fires up his teammates and feels like it comes from a real place, not something he's forcing. Aside from the questions that arose as teams scrutinized Rutschman's medicals with a magnifying class before the draft (described to me as ""stuff consistent with catching and playing football"") he's a perfect prospect subject only to the risk and attrition that all catchers are.","riXzQCIbfPw","sa3011643"
"Jesus Luzardo","OAK","LHP","MLB",6,1,,"60",2020,,"22.8222222","5' 11""","209","L","L",2016,"Draft","WAS",1400000,"Stoneman Douglas HS (FL)","The summer before his senior year of high school, Luzardo looked like a relatively unprojectable pitchability lefty, albeit an advanced one. His fastball was only in the 88-92 range at Area Codes, though his changeup and curveball were each above-average. He did not throw during the fall and instead devoted more time to working out. The following spring, with a new physique, Luzardo's stuff was way up across the board, his fastball now sitting comfortably in the mid-90s, and touching 97. Four starts into his senior season, Luzardo tore his UCL and needed Tommy John. 
After most of the first three rounds of the 2016 draft had come and gone, it seemed as though Luzardo might end up at the University of Miami. Four outings (including the one during which he broke) wasn't enough for many teams to have high-level decision makers get in to see him and want to take him early, but the Nationals (who have a history of drafting pitchers who have fallen due to injury) called his name and signed him for $1.4 million, a bonus equivalent to an early second rounder. Luzardo rehabbed as a National and when he returned the following summer, his stuff had completely returned. He made just three starts for the GCL Nats before he was traded to Oakland as part of the Sean Doolittle/Ryan Madson deal. 
After a dominant first full year in Oakland's system, Luzardo appeared poised to seize a rotation spot early in 2019, when suddenly, the very contagious injury bug that has bedeviled Oakland pitching prospects for the last several years infected his shoulder and, later during rehab, his lat. He was confined to early-morning sim games on the Mesa backfields until June, when he was sent to rehab at Hi-A Stockton and then to Triple-A Nashville, where Luzardo's pitch count climbed back to typical starter norms. Oakland 'penned him for September, a multi-inning weapon for the stretch and playoff run. He was sitting 94-96 and touched 99 as a starter in the minors, the same as he was out of the big league bullpen. It's a sinker, but it has barrel-shattering tail and pairs nicely with both of Luzardo's secondaries, which live at the bottom of the zone and beneath it. He'll add and subtract from his breaking ball to give it a curveball shape that bends into the zone for strikes, or add power to it and coax hitters into waiving at pitches that finish well out of the zone. His changeup is firm but has late bottom and should also miss bats. The violence in Luzardo's delivery combined with his injury history is slightly worrisome, but he was clearly operating at full speed late last year and has top-of-the-rotation stuff and pitchability, so his 60 FV has that risk baked in.","XPMeIpPKW2k","19959"

The changes, based on my notes, are subtle. A narrower base, a little bit deeper load to the hands, and a front side that stays closed a little longer. These are relatively small tweaks to a swing that is comically simple, but the results -- his 2018 groundball rate was between 44-50% depending on the level, while his 2019 rates were 26-32% -- were astounding. It's terrifying that Robert can generate the kind of power he does with such a conservative stride back toward the pitcher, and it juxtaposes with many of the movement-heavy swings that have been pervasive throughout baseball since Josh Donaldson and José Bautista broke out. 
Robert does have plate discipline issues. He chases a lot of breaking balls out of the zone and it took a lot of convincing from industry folks to move him as high on my Top 100 as I did even though Robert has the surface-level traits that tend to make me irrationally excited. He has one of the best physiques in pro sports, he's a plus-plus runner, and his instincts in center field are terrific. The power production and OBP may be somewhat limited by the approach, very similarly to how Starling Marte's have been, but Marte is a 60, so here we are.","yolHGuJGfEk","20043"

I wasn't worried about Pearson being a true injury risk because his maladies (an intercostal strain, a fractured ulna due to a comebacker) have been unrelated to the typically concerning elbow and shoulder stuff. Instead, I wanted to see if he could hold his elite velo under the strain of a full-season workload, and what his secondary stuff would be like when he was forced to pitch through lineups multiple times. Not only did the velo hold water but Pearson's repertoire is very deep. Yes, he'll chuck 101 past you, but he'll also pull the string on a good changeup that runs away from lefty hitters, dump a curveball in for strikes to get ahead of you before gassing you with two strikes, and tilt in one of the harder sliders on the planet, a pitch I've personally seen him throw at 95 mph and that regularly sits in the low-90s. Does he need to throw well above 100 innings to be a true front-end arm? Yes, but that he was able to retain his stuff amid a huge innings increase in 2019 is a sign he'll be able to do so with even more innings folded in. A source with offseason intel tells me Pearson also remade his body and has gotten a little leaner. We won't truly know until he reports to camp, but if that's true, it bolsters my confidence in him sustaining this level of stuff for several years.","t_D8-uewjYw","sa3005097"

One of these shared logins is for a DAZN account I procured in order to enjoy the platform's boxing archive, only to discover it had several classic MLB games as well. Among these is footage of Miguel Cabrera's big league debut, which I put on one fall night as I prepared to cut up Fall League video of Julio Rodriguez taken earlier in the day. As I split my attention between a fresh-faced Miggy and a young Julio, I noticed a rare similarity: front foot variation. Some hitters are capable of altering their stride direction based on pitch location, perhaps best exemplified by a famous GIF of Cabrera hitting home runs on pitches in six very different parts of the strike zone. In that GIF you can faintly make out how Cabrera's footwork varies on several of those swings, and though he doesn't do it consistently yet, Julio shows glimpses of this same seemingly innate aptitude, especially his ability to open up, clear his hips, and wreck pitches on the inner half. 
He can be fooled by sweeping breaking balls that make him want to open up and pull the ball, and he’ll swing at inside sliders that finish away from him, but other than those consistent issues, Rodriguez is a very mature hitter, with a mature personality and body to match. He excelled despite Seattle's very aggressive full-season assignment, a move I was skeptical of, and had an impressive Fall League as an 18-year-old. He's already a 40 runner (I had him timed in the 4.4s throughout Fall League), which means he is ticketed for right field rather than center, but the bat is real. I have plus hit and power projection here and I know scouts who have a 70 on the bat, though his approach and the way his head was flying out during some of his AFL at-bats stopped me from going that heavy with my hit tool grade. I think he's going to come up quickly and be an All-Star outfielder and the affable face of the franchise.","fm1zz74sRbc","sa3005720"

Sent to the Arizona Fall League for extra reps, Bart was the league's star pupil before he was hit by two pitches in the same game, the second of which fractured his right thumb. That ended his season but in that narrow window of health we saw glimpses of Bart's power with physically fit phalanges. And we had plenty of looks at his power, particularly to his pull side, in college, including a titanic blast that cleared the facade of Georgia Tech's football complex in left field and was never found. 
The defensive tools are the foundation of Bart's skillset, the cornerstone of a certain big league future. He's Mike Alstott's size but with the lateral quickness and ground game of a small-framed catcher. He's quick out of his crouch and throws accurate lasers to second base. He also has field general qualities: he's a rousing, vocal leader at times, a calming presence at others. We still have some questions about the hit tool -- we posited Bart was just frustrated by being pitched around in college and developed some bad habits, but he was swing-happy again in 2019. Still, we think he'll get to much or all of his power, play all-world defense, and be an All-Star catcher, a proper heir apparent to Buster Posey.","Cozg_YSvag0","sa3007786"

Despite that, and especially in spite of the wrist injury, the beefcake Wisconsinite hit .291/.364/.540 with 23 dingers and 20 steals across three levels, and reached Double-A as a young 20-year-old. Kelenic is absolutely jacked but it hasn't detracted from his twitch, nor has his size borrowed from his range in center field, which is suitable if unspectacular for the position. 
The carrying tool here is the bat, which has been the case since Kelenic was 15. Like most elite prospects he's been one of the -- if not <em>the</em> -- best hitters his age from the time scouts began to see him, and Kelenic hit elite prep pitching all throughout high school. He is short to the ball with power, and can just turn his hands over and catch heaters up, in, or both, which bodes well for him against a pitching population that is working up there with increasing frequency. The .540 SLG% from 2019 is a bit above what's realistic going forward, largely because there's just no more room for mass on the body. As is the case with most hitters evaluated in this stratosphere, reports of Kelenic's competitiveness and work ethic are strong, and have been since he was in high school. In fact, one scout on the amateur side thought he was too intense at times, sort of in the Jimmy Butler realm of teammate interaction, but I haven't heard anything like that lately. He's much more stick than glove, but Kelenic looks like an All-Star center fielder who's rapidly approaching Seattle.","LFdX2RZaB64","sa3007741"

All of the physical components that many front-end arms have while they're in high school were there when he was an amateur -- shooting guard frame, premium arm strength and athleticism, a breaking ball -- the stuff that enables your imagination to run wild. And Manning succeeded while devoting time to two sports, which caused him to get a late start during his draft spring because the hoops team was in the middle of a deep playoff run (Manning threw late into the prior summer, so this may have actually been good for limiting innings). 
After some initial strike-throwing issues and a change in stride direction, the REM cycle arrived. The walks came down, Manning's changeup got better, and he started working with two different fastballs and was clearly manipulating the shape of his spike curveball depending on the hitter and situation. He's never had arm issues (his 2018 IL stint was due to an oblique injury), and he has rare on-mound athleticism coupled with an understanding of how to pitch. He's going to have three out-pitches thanks to adjustments he's already made, and it's fair to assume he'll be able to make more. Manning is tracking like an All-Star starter and a potential top-of-the-rotation arm.","k-sipbEctAU","sa917924"

To a degree, those remain reasonable, though they're no longer applicable across nearly as much as Lewis' skillset as they once were. Initially, those comps came from Lewis' penchant for on-field leadership, some elements of his swing and frame, and, less positively, his future as a defensive shortstop. The Twins took him first overall and cut a below slot deal, as Lewis was seen as one of five options in a tightly-packed top tier of talent. 
Throughout his first 18 months as a pro, Lewis had statistical success while being promoted aggressively before a developmental hiccup in 2019. His overall production has slowly come down at each subsequent level, and during a 2019 season split 3-to-1 at Hi- and Double-A, he had a .290 OBP. Don't let the robust .353/.411/.565 Arizona Fall League line (he went to pick up reps after an oblique strain during the year) and MVP award fool you -- Lewis still clearly had issues. His swing is cacophonous -- the big leg kick, the messy, excessive movement in his hands -- and it negatively impacts Lewis' timing. He needs to start several elements of the swing early just to catch fastballs, and he's often late anyway. This also causes him to lunge at breaking balls, which Lewis doesn't seem to recognize very well, and after the advanced hit tool was a huge driver of his amateur profile, Lewis now looks like a guess hitter. His mannerisms -- Nomar-level batting glove tinkering, deep, heavy, deliberate breaths between pitches, constant uniform adjustment -- are manic, and they seem to pull focus away from the task at hand rather than grounding him in a ritualistic way, and the game often seems too fast for him. 
So why are we still so high on him? We're betting big on Lewis' makeup and physical talent. His BP's were the best in the entire Fall League. He is an exceptional teammate, leader, and worker, who did more early infield work than anyone else Eric saw in the AFL, willing himself to become a viable left side infield defender even though he lacks the traditional grace and fluidity for those positions. We don't think the swing works as currently constituted -- it's a mechanical departure from when Lewis was successful in high school -- but we think it'll get dialed in eventually because of his athleticism and work habits. Even if some of the pitch recognition stuff proves to be a long-term issue, we still think Lewis will be a versatile defender who plays several premium positions (we have him listed in center field because if we had to pick one spot where we think he'll eventually be best, that's it) and hits for considerable power. There may be an adjustment period similar to the one Javier Báez experienced early in his career because of the approach issues, but the star-level talent will eventually shine through.","IRGoLxDpn0U","sa3004259"

His fastballs, both the two and four-seam variants, are parked in the 93-97 range and peak at 99 mph. His low-ish arm slot gives his heater sinker shape, which means it's more likely to induce weak groundballs than it is to miss a lot of bats, though May occasionally uncorks two-seamers that run off the hips of left-handed hitters and back into the zone like vintage Bartolo Colon. Based on how he worked in the big leagues last year, May's out-pitch is going to be his low-90s cutter, which he commands to his glove side (he has great east/west command of everything). This is despite the fact that his vertically-breaking slider (May calls it a slider, but it has curveball shape) has one of the better spin rates in the minors and enough vertical depth to miss bats against both left and right-handed hitters. He's shown an ability to backdoor it to lefties and it was a finishing pitch for him in some of my minor league viewings, but it was de-emphasized in the big leagues, perhaps because it doesn't pair well with his fastballs. After trying several different changeup grips in 2017, it seems like May is still searching for a good cambio, but his fastball and breaking ball command should suffice against lefties for now, though I'd like to see more backfoot breaking balls against them this year. 
This is nit-picky, but May's leg kick can make him slow to home and he can be vulnerable to stolen bases as a result, which forces him to vary his cadence home in an attempt to stymie runners. Regardless, he projects as an All-Star, mid-rotation starter.","xvHfqB6Fl5w","19716"

He wields one of the deepest repertoires in all of the minors and, though the elite-looking changeup he showed during the 2018 Fall League was not present in 2019, all of his stuff is still above-average or better, both visually and on paper. 
The strike-throwing hiccup isn't great, but Whitley clearly knows where his stuff plays best (fastballs up, the cutter and slider to his glove side, and the curveball beneath the zone -- a well-designed mix nearly ubiquitous in this system) and he works in those locations pretty loosely. Inefficiency might limit Whitley's inning totals, but it's unlikely to prevent him from starting. Ideally, Whitley shows up to camp in better shape than he appeared to be in during the Fall League; he underwent a much more drastic athletic metamorphosis in high school (which coincided with his pre-draft velo spike), so it seems very possible. The top of a rotation ceiling that seemed possible a year ago would now require a bit of a bounce back in stuff and a quantum control/command leap. That seems unlikely, but a mid-rotation/All-Star ceiling still exists.","5krfMUxyV_M","sa917930"

Mize has hellacious stuff. His four-pitch mix has actually gotten better since college because he and the Tigers successfully added greater demarcation between his cutter and slider, the latter of which now has more two-plane sweep. His entire repertoire is capable of missing bats, like Manning's, but Mize's split is superior to Manning's change and he has an additional weapon, the cutter, that Manning does not. 
So why ever-so-slightly prefer Manning? Mize's injury track record is as scary as his stuff. Some teams had concerns about his shoulder when he was a draft-eligible high schooler, he had elbow issues as a sophomore at Auburn, he had a PRP injection after he pitched for Team USA the summer before his draft year, and in 2019, he missed a month with a shoulder injury. After Mize returned, he had some outings where his fastball was in the 90-92 range, he used his splitter less frequently, and when he did use it, it had more spin than usual. It's speculation, but perhaps he was tinkering with changeup grips after the injury. That's an awful lot of smoke. Purely on quality of stuff, Mize is arguably the top pitching prospect in all of baseball. We still love him and think it's perfectly reasonable to consider him the top youngster in this system and one of the best on the planet, but what Manning has become, what he might continue to develop into based on his athleticism and now-evident ability to make adjustments, combined with his much, much cleaner bill of health, shades him ahead of Mize, in our (mostly Eric's) opinion, within the same FV tier.","KTLpXoKizJU","sa3008444"

He was unusually homer-prone during his big league stretch, something that has never been an issue before even with middling velocity, because McKay's command is so good. I think it's a small sample blip that will regress over more innings, though I did have folks from analytically-inclined teams suggest that I slide McKay down on my overall rankings when I circulated the list for feedback. 
His fastball only sits 90-94 and touches 96, which is pretty average, but McKay keeps it away from the middle of the zone where it can really be hammered and often ties hitters up with it because he locates so well; his swinging strike rate on the heater was close to 17% in the minors, so I think it'll play. His cutter command is arguably even better, and he peppers the glove side of the plate with it at will. Changeup usage was scarce in his big league sample but I think it will be one of the focal points of his repertoire, perhaps usurping the curveball, which has a stronger visual evaluation than it does if you look at the spin data. It's a repertoire/command profile similar to a lot of good lefties (Hyun-Jin Ryu, Mike Minor, Cole Hamels), though most of them are more reliant on the cambio than McKay has been to this point. He may not have the rate stats of the other arms in the 60 FV tier, but I expect he'll make up for all of that with volume because of how efficiently he works.","aCKSVKfZpv0","20186"

It was a coronation of sorts, an indication that the then-teenager would be ready for the bright lights of Petco Park when the Padres call on him, which might happen in 2020, even if it's out of the bullpen at first. (There are some executives who think that will be Patiño's ultimate role.) He's smaller, and his changeup and command are not very good yet. But this is one of the best on-mound athletes in the minors, one who hasn't been pitching all that long, and has had premium velocity for an even shorter span of time. It'd be unreasonable to expect a 20-year-old to be fully realized when he's only been pitching for about four years. Patiño's velocity came on in a huge way as he got on a pro strength program and he's added 40 pounds of good weight and about 10 ticks of velo since he signed. He's a charismatic autodidact who has taken a similarly proactive approach to learning a new language (he became fluent in English very quickly, totally of his own volition) as he has to incorporating little tricks and twists into his delivery (he's borrowed from Mac Gore) to mess with hitters. 
Were this a college prospect, he'd be in the conversation for the draft's top pick, and I'm very comfortable projecting on the command and changeup because of the athleticism/makeup combination. I expect Patiño will reach the big leagues this year in a bullpen capacity and compete for a rotation spot in 2021.","k11tj7Ee2qs","sa3002792"

In the seven minor league starts before his big league debut, he walked just four batters, and was similarly efficient in his first few big league outings. But in his final start, the Tigers shelled him and his velocity was down; an MRI revealed he would need Tommy John. The timing was particularly cruel, not just because things had started to click, but also because late-season TJs usually cost the pitcher all of the following year, and indeed, Kopech didn't throw in a game environment until the 2019 instructional league. His first fastball in the fall? Ninety-nine miles per hour, and he sat 94-99 on the Camelback Ranch backfields.
His stuff is great, headlined by a mid-90s fastball that often crests 100 mph. The command inroads Kopech made late in 2018 are especially important for his ability to deal with lefties, because his changeup feel is not very good. He'll need to mix his two breaking balls together to deal with them, and his slider feel is way ahead of the curveball. So long as Kopech's stuff returns, he has No. 3 starter ceiling if the command comes with it, and high-leverage relief ability if it does not.","JXUYoulUEo8","17282"

He had a 17% swinging strike rate last year (if we 20-80'd swinging strike rates, that'd be a 30), and you might quibble with elements of the swing, most notably that the bat path only allows for power in certain parts of the zone, and Pache has a passive, shorter move forward. The hand speed and rotational ability to hit for power is there, and he's athletic enough to make adjustments in order to get to that power (selectivity might also be an issue), which, coupled with some of the flashiest, most acrobatic defense in pro baseball, gives Pache a cathedral ceiling. 
Even though he's already started to slow down a little bit, Pache's reads in center, his contortionistic ability to slide and dive at odd angles to make tough catches, and his arm strength combine to make him a premium defensive center fielder -- he's a likely Gold Glover barring unexpected, precipitous physical regression.

This is a special hitting talent who has performed up through Triple-A as a college-aged shortstop, and Anthony Rendon's departure opens the door for at-bats right away. 
We don't really like Kieboom at shortstop. He's a little heavy-footed and his hands are below average. He's arguably better-suited for second or third base, but one could argue he's at least as good as Trea Turner is there right now (Kieboom has worse range but can make more throws), so the short- and long-term fit here may be different.

He had no trouble with the leap from amateur to pro velocity, though some of the top high school pitching he saw the summer before his draft year was probably better than what he faced in the 2019 AZL. He has a knack for impacting the baseball in a way that creates hard contact even though his swing is currently pretty flat, and he can do this all over the strike zone. Of the trio of elite AZL prospects (Abrams, Bobby Witt, and Marco Luciano), Abrams has the most polished hit tool and the most room left on his frame. Even without a swing change, he's going to grow into more power just through maturity, which is pretty scary considering his exit velos are already above big league average (though, again, AZL pitching wasn't good last year). 
I don't think he's a shortstop. When he has time to step and throw, Abrams has enough arm for the left side of the infield, but ask him to contort his body and make tough throws on balls he has to go get and the results are mixed. Most players with this issue end up in center field, where Abrams could be a plus defender because of his speed, assuming his instincts there aren't terrible. He has top-of-the-order traits right now and is a virtual lock to play somewhere up the middle, even if it isn't at short.","UhCOxi0kL08","sa3010152"

He also has a swing geared for pullside lift (he can bend at the waist to go down and yank balls away from him, too) and the power to hit balls out even when he swings a little flat-footed. He is the son of a former big leaguer and carries himself like one, which has endeared him to scouts and coaches during the course of a high-profile amateur career laden with very high expectations.

Last January, when most baseball facilities across the country were dark, just feet away from oblivious Peloton riders and tennis-playing retirees, a lucky few scouts and media folks had a religious experience watching the sweetest-swinging teenager on Earth absolutely roast balls fed to his barrel by a high-speed pitching machine. Because of how close you can sit next to the field there, you can feel the sonic force of bat-to-ball impact radiate into your body. When Marco Luciano connects, you feel it to your core. He is not normal. To find bat speed comps you need to look toward Javier Baez, Eric Davis, whatever the top of your mental catalog might be. And while he already generates plenty of it, Luciano's square-shouldered frame indicates more power might be coming. The length created by Luciano's natural, uppercut swing is offset by the explosiveness in his hands; he's not particularly strikeout-prone and he doesn't take out-of-control hacks. Unless something unforeseen about Luciano's approach is exposed as he moves through the minors, all of this power seems likely to actualize. His AZL walk rate is encouraging early evidence that he's unlikely to be so exposed.
As an athlete and infielder, Luciano is only fair. He might play a passable shortstop one day because his hands and actions are fine most of the time, but he can't presently make strong, accurate throws from multiple platforms. It looks increasingly likely that he'll move to the outfield, enough so that some scouts have him projected there, but it's too early to cut bait and move him. He has elite hitting talent, he's produced on paper, and he already has average exit velos and a hard-hit rate that grade as 65 on the scale. If he continues to perform, especially if the Giants send him right to Augusta and he hits his way to San Jose, then this time next year we'll be talking about Marco Luciano as one of the best prospects in baseball, and if he does so while improving his infield defense, perhaps <em>the</em> best.","UrZDHmjnjrY","sa3010022"

Then he tore his UCL and needed Tommy John, which kept him out for all of 2018 and most of 2019. Throughout the spring of 2019, you could just show up to Fitch Park in Mesa and run into one of Luzardo, Puk, James Kaprielian, or any of several other high-profile A's rehabbers. Puk got into game action in April and May, throwing as many as four innings in an outing (that I'm aware of, anyway) before he was finally sent to an affiliate in June, but only in a two-inning start or bullpen capacity. He never threw more than 47 pitches in an outing and was limited to 20 or 30 bullets when the A's finally called him up in September. He threw fewer curveballs in that role than he theoretically will as a starter, making that pitch tough to evaluate when he returned, but all the other weapons are intact, and Puk should contribute to Oakland's rotation in 2020 assuming there's a season.

He moved to the rotation in March and crosscheckers started showing up to see him much later than is typical for a first look at a second round talent. In 2018, his first full season as a member of the rotation, Howard thrived and late in the year his stuff took off. He was sitting 94-98 and working with three nasty secondary pitches. That carried over to his first four starts of 2019 but was interrupted by shoulder soreness that benched him for two months. After he returned, the Phillies moved him pretty quickly to Double-A for six starts, then had him finish in the Fall League. His stuff was great in Arizona. He touched 99, sat mostly 93-97, his curveball and changeup were both plus, and his slider's two-plane tilt gives Howard a second viable breaker, capable of garnering whiffs when it's located away from righties. He barely pitched at Double-A last year and is likely to start 2020 there, but if he's good for a month, especially in hitter-friendly Reading, then a promotion to Lehigh Valley makes sense.

His exit velo data is not great, but it was instructive to watch Brujan in the Fall League next to several other players with similar statistical and defensive profiles who aren't nearly as athletic or as physically projectable as he is. There were lots of other narrowly built infielders of similar age who simply don't have Brujan's musculature (you can see his lats through his jersey) or explosiveness. I think there's room for mass even though Brujan is short, and that he'll continue to harness his hellacious cut, which, based on his contact rates, he already has abnormal control over. I watched Brujan swing so hard that he'd corkscrew himself to the ground, only to pop back up like a Russian folk dancer. There are scouts who think he can play shortstop, but I think the arm is a little light for that and that instead, he'll be a plus-plus defender at second base or perhaps play a multi-positional, up-the-middle role.

Even as a 17-year-old on Arizona's backfields, he stood apart physically from rehabbing big leaguers several years his senior, and instantly attracted evaluators' attention, like the gravitational pull of a very dense star. And star is apt because that's the kind of projection Robinson's tools allow for. Big, fast, and prone to generating thunderous contact, he's more physically alike to young SEC pass catchers than most of the baseball-playing universe. But the background -- a giant, Bahamian man-child without the showcase track record of most of his Dominican peers -- meant the industry knew even less about how Robinson would handle pro pitching than it did the average J2 prospect. After some initial inconsistencies, Robinson has not only quelled those concerns but also surpassed expectations, and in 2019 he clubbed his way from the Northwest League to full-season ball as an 18-year-old.
Robinson's bat path lacks the lift necessary to produce in-game power on par with his raw, but the foundation of his swing is sound, with nothing too complicated despite Robinson's size. He's already hitting 50% of his balls in play with an exit velo of 95 mph or more, which is up in Joey Gallo/Nelson Cruz territory, it's just often low-lying contact. Robinson's fast enough to continue being developed in center field, but there's a good chance he ends up on a big league roster with a superior defender who kicks him to right. His ceiling, that of a 35 homer force who can play a passable center, hasn't changed since he first began appearing on the electronic pages of FanGraphs; his progress is just evidence that such a future is becoming more likely.","U24cWc3kkog","sa3006884"

Baseball's Brendan Rodgers has been known to scouts for about that long, and has been hitting the entire time. Even as an underclassman, Rodgers was often the best player on the field at well-attended showcase events; when he was a high school junior, scouts thought that if you were to drop him in the draft a year early, he'd still go somewhere in the first round. By his pre-draft summer, Rodgers clearly had the best hit and power combination among his peers, and looked likely to stay on the middle infield. He was the early favorite to go first overall in 2015 until Dansby Swanson, Alex Bregman, and Andrew Benintendi took a leap the following spring, allowing the Rockies to get him third overall. 
One axiom to which we try to adhere is ""good hitters hit all the time"" and that is indeed what Rodgers has done for the last eight years. He's a career .293/.348/.491 hitter in the minors, and while most of Colorado's affiliates play in hitter-friendly parks -- this fact has masked some of Rodgers' mediocre pitch recognition -- we anticipate he'll continue to be a plus hitter in the big leagues. His initial major league trial -- a rough 25-game jaunt in the early summer -- was not especially encouraging. Rodgers hit .224, swung and missed twice as often as he had in Triple-A (8% swinging strike rate in the minors, 15% in the majors), and generally appeared overwhelmed. But an 80 plate appearance sample doesn't usurp Rodgers' lengthy track record of hitting. In November, Rodgers told the <em>Denver Post</em> that he had been dealing with ""nagging"" shoulder issues since 2018 before deciding to have labrum surgery in June of 2019. As of mid-November, he had yet to begin throwing and hitting. Because he's only a fringe runner and athlete, Rodgers' conditioning during rehab is pretty important. A heavy, lumbering Rodgers who needs to play third base is swimming upstream against a 105 wRC+ at the position, while a Rodgers capable of playing second has a 94 wRC+ bar to clear.","8R3NqST3CPs","17907"

What if this guy, who I'll once again body-comp to Harold Carmichael and Brandon Ingram before I search for a less instructive baseball avatar, actually stays there and grows into 80-grade raw power? How bad would the contact issues need to be for him not to be a great player if that's the case? 
Indeed there are folks in baseball who are skeptical of Cruz's hit tool because of his lever length, and those concerns are exacerbated by how often he likes to swing. There are several vastly different ideas as to how his body and game will develop as he fills out, and scouts who think Cruz is destined to slow down and move to right field or first base, and who also have concerns about the contact, don't even think he belongs on this list. But consider this: At this age Aaron Judge, who is as close as we're going to get to a physical peer for Cruz, was striking out 21% of the time at Fresno State. Split between Hi- and Double-A, against competition way better than Mountain West Conference pitching, Cruz whiffed 25% of the time. That's not bad for someone this age and this size. I will concede that the approach is bad and that the swing needs polish if Cruz is going to get to his power in games. I'll also concede that the Fall League look was bad (he missed several weeks with a foot fracture), and his LIDOM performance was, too. This is one of the -- if not <em>the</em> -- highest-variance players in the minors, but there aren't many who have a chance to be what this guy might. Even the outcomes more toward the middle of what is likely -- a center fielder with a hit tool in the 35-40 range with huge power, a right fielder or third baseman with the same, a gigantic target at first -- are still fine.

The swap meant Miami gave up six years of what looks like a mid-rotation starter for six-ish years of Chisholm, who might be a superstar or strikeout too much to be anything at all.

We want to see another year of plus walk rates (Chisholm walked 11% of the time in 2019, up from a career 8%) before we declare that to be a true part of the skillset, but the power is real (a 91.4 mph average exit velo would put him in the top 40 of the majors, while 48% of his balls in play being over 95 mph would be in the top 30), the lift is there (he has a career groundball rate in the low 30% range and a 17 degree average launch angle according to a source), and we think he has a chance to be an above-average defensive shortstop, though for the first time we had one dissenting source on the glove. He also performed statistically as a 21-year-old at Double-A. One of several radionuclides in this system, Chisholm has its highest ceiling.","ir2kVOIT4mE","sa919327"

Keller quickly got comfortable locating that slider, which has an awful lot of sweep for a pitch in the upper-80s, to his glove side. He can throw competitively-located changeups against left-handed hitters, but in big spots a well-placed slider is just a nastier option.

He was three and a half years younger than the average Sally League player and was still hitting an impressive .283/.323/.381 before he had a lousy August. The exciting physical characteristics -- a lanky, projectable frame, the sort you typically see on the mound, the hands, actions, feet, and arm strength for short, precocious feel to hit -- shared by Mauricio's franchise-altering shortstop predecessors, the stuff that had us deliriously excited about him before he even signed, are still present. 
The explosiveness and physicality of cornerstone, power-hitting shortstops still percolates beneath the surface, which is fine because Mauricio will be 18 until April and it isn't reasonable to expect that he'd already have grown into impact power. When most players his age are either in the midst of their freshman season of college or getting ready to start Extended Spring Training, he might be in the Florida State League. Because he'll be so young and in a pitcher-friendly league, it's very likely that a year from now, we'll be ignoring a pretty lousy statline for contextual reasons. With another full year of data to consider, we now know Mauricio is a little swing-happy and that, even if that explosion arrives, he either needs to develop feel for lift or tweak the swing if all the power is to actualize. Hopefully we're not living in the timeline where Mauricio outgrows shortstop and those two things remain issues. Switch-hitting shortstops with power, uh, don't really exist. That Mauricio has a chance to be one means he may one day be the top overall prospect in baseball, and several outcomes short of that ideal are still very, very good.","NvOA8y_cZGI","sa3006887"

Marsh still hit the ball on the ground a lot during the regular season and only averaged about five degrees of launch angle, but by his Fall League stint things clearly looked different. Like Jo Adell showed late in the fall, Marsh's hands loaded a little farther out away from his body and he had what some scouts called a ""wrap"" or ""power tip,"" where the bat head angled toward the mound a bit, setting up more of a loop than a direct path to the ball. I thought he lifted the ball better during that six week stretch and did so without compromising his strong feel for contact. Marsh is a better outfield defender that Adell and projects as a clean fit in center field, which, so long as this development holds, should enable him to be an above-average everday player.","f6w57ie4WkA","sa917944"

Vaughn started seeing a lot of breaking balls once conference play began -- about 15% fewer fastballs to be more exact. He was pitched around and unable to make as much impact contact, but all the tools were still there. Vaughn has a very selective approach, letting strikes he can't drive pass him by unless he has to put a ball in play, a skill I compared before the draft to Paul Konerko's (I mentioned this to a Special Assistant who scoffed and said he thought Vaughn was way better). He has a very athletic swing despite being decidedly unathletic in every other way, enabling all fields power and high rates of contact. 
There's no margin for error for right-handed hitting first baseman, but if there's one prospect to be confident in hitting as much as is necessary to profile at first, it's someone with this combination of visual evaluation and statistical track record. Vaughn's post-draft TrackMan data is also supportive, and suggests he could be a .300/.400/.500 hitter. How fast he comes up and where he plays when he arrives (it's 1B/DH but José Abreu exists, Edwin Encarnación is on a one-year deal, Eloy Jiménez might have a DH body soon, Micker Adolfo already does, and Nomar Mazara was added this winter) will be dictated by those around him.","cPv9SsBcKQk","sa3011226"

Tork only fits as a 1B, as he body comps to Yankees 1B Luke Voit. It's a tough profile, but his track record and tools, which are very similar to Andrew Vaughn's, are sufficient to generate confidence and top-of-the-draft enthusiasm anyway.

He struck out a lot (again) during the 2018 stretch run, when St. Louis pushed him to Low-A Peoria because he wasn't being challenged in Johnson City. Sent back to Peoria for the first half of 2019, Gorman adjusted to full-season pitching and roasted the Midwest League to the tune of a .241/.344/.448 line, cutting his strikeout rate by eight percentage points. He was promoted to the Florida State League for the second half, and while his walk rate halved and his strikeout rate crept above 30% again, Gorman still managed to post an above-average line for that league as a 19-year-old. The strikeout issues will only become a real concern once Gorman stops showing an ability to adjust over a long period of time. 
His huge power, derived from his imposing physicality and explosive hand speed, is likely to play in games because of the lift in Gorman's swing and his feel for impacting the ball in the air. Because we're talking about a teenager of considerable size, there's a chance Gorman has to move off of third base at some point, but for now we're cautiously optimistic about him staying there for the early part of his big league tenure. There are apt body comps to be made to either of the Seager brothers, while the offensive profile looks more like Miguel Sanó's.","_2qk0vq7IEA","sa3007017"

But even we didn't expect he'd nearly go 20/20 and slug .518 at Double-A Springfield. Judging by the fervor this performance created among our more fantasy-focused readers, they may be wondering why we were ahead of the curve a year ago, but aren't hitting the gas on Carlson's evaluation now after the year he had. We certainly like him -- Carlson is balanced and coordinated while hitting from both sides of the plate, his left-handed swing has gorgeous lift and finish, he has advanced bat control for a switch-hitter this age, he's athletic and moves well for his size, and he has high-end makeup. But we have some questions about the ultimate ceiling. 
Carlson is an average runner and a large dude for a 20-year-old. His instincts in center field are okay, but not good enough to overcome long speed that typically falls short at the position. Because of where we have his arm strength graded, we think he fits in left field or at first base. The TrackMan data we sourced also indicates that his 2019 line is a bit of a caricature. His average exit velo (about 88 mph) and rate of balls in play at 95 mph or higher (about 34%) are both right around the big league average, rather than exceptional. The in-office types we talk to about this kind of thing are in love with Carlson because he's only 20, and they anticipate these things will improve, but visual evaluation of his build don't suggest as much physical projection as is typical of someone this young, because he's already a big guy. As a result, he was on the 50/55 FV line for us during the process of compiling this list. The league-average offensive production in left field has been lower than you might expect (it's 100 wRC+ over the last five years) and Carlson might also be able to play a situational center field when the Cards are behind and need offense, as well as some first base. That versatility is valuable, so he tipped into the 55 FV range. But we think he's closer to the line than one might conclude if they were just looking at his surface stats.","5Qo_OiBtqnA","sa917940"

Though his Hi-A statline was aided by the Cal League's hitting environment, Campusano's 11% strikeout rate was the second best rate among qualified, full-season backstops in 2019 (Yohel Pozo was first) and his exit velos (89 mph on average) are great for a 20-year-old.

That's fine, though. Second base has the lowest league-wide wRC+ of all the non-catching positions right now and several punchless contact hitters have had good careers (Arraez was a 2 WAR player in 90 games, Joe Panik was a 50 FV, etc.), and most all of them are nowhere near the runner or defender that Madrigal is -- he has some of the fastest hands I've seen around the bag, and he's going to steal outs because of how quickly he turns feeds from Tim Anderson around to first base.

But one could argue there's a selection bias for height in the pitching population, perhaps one that'll melt away as we keep learning about approach angle, and, because part of the formula for torque (which could theoretically be used as a measure of stress on the elbow) is the distance from the fulcrum, that longer-armed, usually taller pitchers might actually be more of an injury risk than a little guy like Deivi. It's unusual to project heavily on the command of a Triple-A pitcher but it isn't strange to do so on that of a 20-year-old, so even if there are some growing pains related to Garcia's fastball command it's good to remember he's the age of most college pitchers in this year's draft. 
Garcia has big stuff. He works 91-95, mostly at the top of the zone when he's locating, and backs up that pitch with a knee-buckling, old school 12-to-6 curveball that has big depth and bite. He sells his changeup by mimicking his fastball's arm speed but doesn't create great movement on that pitch right now. A better third offering during the early part of his career will probably be his mid-80s slider, though that will be more dependent on command to play. It's possible for a starter to be a 55 when they only throw 120 or fewer innings (Brandon Woodruff and Blake Snell did it last year) but it's much easier if you inch closer to 140. We may find out about Garcia's ability to do that in 2020 if the Yankees increase his innings as they have the last two years, or the big club may need to stick him in a lower-volume role immediately.","TtDspHp7TRI","sa916944"

The other concern is his aggressive approach at the plate, which didn't give him any trouble until his taste of Triple-A late in 2019, and some scouts and analysts think it could be a problem in the big leagues. 
That's the soft part of the profile, but the indicators both to the eye (scouts rave about the swing, bat speed, and feel at the plate) and in the stats point to elite ability to manipulate the bat. One club told us his percentage of balls hit with 95 mph-plus exit velo and a launch angle between 10 and 30 degrees (i.e. hard hit line drives and fly balls) was in the top 3% of the entire minor leagues. And that comes as a 20-year-old in the upper minors who has plus speed and a plus arm, and who profiles in center field, with other variables that could allow you to keep rounding up from there. The happy version of this story is Starling Marte, and as soon as the middle of 2020; the sad version includes multiple years stuck in neutral at the big league level, trying to argue that the upside and defense makes up for the big strikeout rate.

The Braves amateur department really stuck out their necks in 2016 by cutting an underslot deal with Anderson, and then using the savings to sign Kyle Muller and Bryse Wilson, who are both key near-term pitching staff stalwarts, and Joey Wentz, who was traded.

Last year he was again up to 96 but sat 91-94, about the halfway mark between his peak and nadir as an amateur. Considering how readily pitchers lose velo in pro ball, that's still a win for Seattle.

Barring a rep-based leap in center field, he projects to be a 45 defender at all three spots, but the versatility is valuable on its own. 
This wasn't the first developmental alteration the Cubs made. Hoerner's swing changed not long after he was drafted. He was making lots of hard, low-lying contact at Stanford, but since signing he has added a subtle little bat wrap that has made a substantial difference in how he impacts the ball. He hit for much more power than was anticipated after he signed and may not have repeated the SLG in 2019 because of the wrist injury.

Despite the patience and bat control, I think he ends up with closer to average contact ability but fully actualized power production, a well-rounded offensive package that cleanly profiles at second base.

There is a gap between how many bats his fastball misses (he has 8% swinging strike rate on the heater, where the big league average on all pitches is 11%) and what you might expect at this velocity (Sixto averages 97, touches 101) because it has sinking/tailing movement rather than ride. Whether Miami player dev can adjust that without compromising Sanchez's control and health remains to be seen. 
His changeup, which is one of the better ones in the minors, will be his primary out pitch unless or until that happens. The cambio has bat-missing, screwball action, so much that it dips beneath the barrel of right-handed hitters as well as away from lefties. Sanchez can also run it back over the corner of the glove side of the plate, freezing perplexed hitters. Though his slider has plus spin, it's horizontal wipe means it needs to be located off the plate to work, but Sixto, especially considering how little he's pitched in his life and how far backwards his build has gone on him to this point, commands it pretty well. The same arm slot/hand position change that might add more ride to the fastball could add more depth to the breaking ball, but you could argue that such a change is an unnecessary risk considering Sixto's injury history and how well everything already works. 
Knowledge of the fastball efficacy gap combined with the injury history has us down on Sixto a little bit. He still has top-of-the rotation upside, there's just more developmental work to do to get there than we thought there was a year ago.","OFHkPmNCPOI","sa873550"

Healthy Bleday was not only one of the more polished hitters in his draft class but one of the most physically gifted as well. In addition to having a superlative feel for the strike zone, Bleday is also short to the ball but still creates lift. He murders offspeed stuff, has all-fields ability, and can mishit balls with power -- he's a complete offensive package. He's also pretty fast, and his instincts in the outfield could make him a plus corner defender.

During his pre-draft summer, Greene was a little soft-bodied, his running gait was odd, and he seemed destined to play little more than an average outfield corner. The player scouts watched the following spring had a better physical composition, was more explosive and a better runner, and had as ripe a high school hit tool as was available in the draft. This was similar to how Jarred Kelenic's skills were colored as he came out of high school. 
Greene's swing, curated by his father from an early age, is beautiful. He can clear his hips and turn on just about anything on the inner half, drop the bat head and lift balls with power, strike balls the other way with authority, and he tracked and whacked many high school benders. The bend and flexion in Greene's front knee as his swing clears the point of impact is reminiscent of several Dodger hitters. Though there are many examples of Greene having certain types of athleticism (he is a tremendous leaper, for instance), he's not a runner and we don't have him in center field.

Scouts liked what they saw, but not enough to meet a price tag that was up around $1 million according to sources. Skubal went back to school and was horrendous early in the year before he slowly began to throw more and more strikes. Now 29 teams and their evaluators are cursing themselves for either failing to notice that upward trend throughout the 2018 spring, or for noticing but lacking conviction in the draft room. 
There are some folks in baseball who have Skubal right up in the same tier with Mize and Manning. He has a dominant fastball, equal parts velocity, ride, and tough-to-square angle. So unhittable is Skubal's heater that he's struck out 37% of hitters during his pro career (48% over the final few weeks over Double-A play last year) while throwing the pitch roughly 70% of the time. No current big leaguer with a fastball that plays at the top of the zone throws their fastball that much; anyone close to 70% is a sinkerballer. An occasionally good changeup and slider aside, Skubal's secondaries are not all that great in a vacuum, but luckily they too benefit from the funky angle created by Skubal's cross-bodied, high-slot delivery. His overall swinging strike rate (18%) was higher than the rate on his fastball alone (15%), which means the secondaries were a net positive for him, but we're unsure of what big league hitters will do if they know a fastball aimed at the letters is coming most of the time. So while he's had nothing but goofy strikeout rates for two years, we think Skubal ends up more toward the middle of a rotation rather than the front.","bcoy-xb3kJY","sa3007593"

If anything, this swing is less noisy than his college iteration, and somehow a 6-foot-5, long-levered guy with big power managed to have just a 14% strikeout rate at Double-A last year. Bohm has enough raw power to hit balls hard even with a low-effort cut, and he's been able to hit balls all over the zone because of how direct his swing is. Can he play third base?

Some of that success was probably because he was one of the oldest prospects in the 2019 graduating class, which prompted him to accelerate his schooling in 2017 and reclassify for the 2018 draft. Moving up a year made him age-appropriate for a high schooler in their draft year; at 18.4, he was basically average for a prep player. With that early-career acclaim came a change in the way opposing pitchers approached Casas. They began to pitch around him, and scouts often left his games having seen him swing just once or twice because he walked constantly. Luckily Casas had a long track record of hitting in games, had participated in multiple home run derbies during his amateur summers, and posted gaudy exit velocities during team pre-draft workouts, so clubs knew what his offensive potential was. 
He has good hands and a plus arm that helped him pitch into the low-90's on the mound, but is a well-below average runner with poor lateral mobility. He played third base after signing, though mostly during instructs, as Casas injured his thumb sliding for a ground ball in June, needed surgery, and barely played during the summer. But expectations are that he'll move across the diamond to first base in 2019 or 2020, where we think he'll be quite good. Casas' calling card is his bat and there's potential for a 60 hit, 70 game power, 80 raw power kind of package. The margin for error for teenage, first base-only types is very small, but we're also very high on Casas' bat.","900T_ozI7iY","sa3007634"

His power output was way down for the first few weeks after he returned from both, which is typical of wrist injuries, but that the issue recurred is somewhat concerning on its own. Healthy Kirilloff is going to hit and hit for power. He can turn on balls most hitters are jammed by because of the way he strides open and clears his hips, but he still has the plate coverage and swing path to lift contact the other way when pitchers work away from him. A thickening build has slowed Kirilloff down, and he's now begun seeing a lot of time at first base. This, combined with a pretty aggressive approach, makes him somewhat risky from some teams' perspectives, who see a first baseman with below-average plate discipline, but we think he's a safe bet to be a .340 to .360 wOBA guy even with how swing-happy he can be.","l3xPPnRQA7o","sa917929"

While we expect that future changes to the way balls and strikes are called (i.e. an electronic strike zones) will make it so below-average receivers like Varsho can catch quite comfortably, it's also going to raise the offensive bar at the position in a way that alters how we think about catchers generally. Once framing became quantifiable, the average wRC+ at catcher went from about 93 down into the mid-80s. If that skill becomes moot, catcher offense will certainly rise. 
Varsho's case is unique, as is his skillset for the position. He's a plus runner who might steal 30 bases at peak, a contact-oriented, gap-to-gap hitter with catalytic qualities found in old school one and two-hole hitters. How much of that spark erodes if Varsho is asked to take a beating behind the dish one hundred times a summer? Probably some, and when paired with his defensive shortcomings -- he has a fringe arm, trouble catching balls cleanly, especially toward the bottom of the zone, and at times struggles to block breaking stuff in the dirt -- there are suddenly several reasons to limit his catching reps and deploy him in left field, or perhaps try to hide him at second base. Varsho seems motivated to catch and he's both quite athletic and highly competitive, two things that often help prospects carve paths to unlikely big league outcomes. So while we think it's becoming less likely that he will be an everyday catcher, we're still in on his offensive ability, makeup, and rare collection of skills, and remain intrigued by the proposition (and growing likelihood) that he'll be a dynamic, multi-positional player who catches once in a while.","PRI2SxGhQ6g","sa3002838"

He was a power/speed prep bat without a clear position, but most of the amateur half of the industry assumed he'd be able to play center field if not shortstop or third base, where he played in high school. He quickly moved to the outfield and has played almost exclusively in center since 2017. He isn't great there, but most of Lowe's other abilities have been slow to develop, so it's possible the feel for the position will come eventually. For instance, Lowe has power but has been strikeout prone since his prep days. But once he started playing pro games and generating data, it became clear that, despite the whiffs, he had a great idea of the strike zone. The raw power didn't really show up in games until Lowe's batted ball profile began to shift in 2018. His groundball rates were in the mid-40% range until that year but slowly began shifting downward, then Lowe had a breakout statistical 2019 as a 21-year-old at Double-A. 
He's always going to strike out, but he's also probably going to keep walking a lot, especially now that the power is a real threat. It's pretty important that he stay in center field to take some pressure off of the hit tool. If he can do that, he'll be an everyday player.","FpeotjI5qYU","sa917926"

But the injuries, Murphy's age (some of the sixish years I'm projecting here include his early 30s now), and the fact that some of his skills (he's become a good receiver) may soon be less important caused me to round down. 
Now if he starts hitting for more power in games, that's a horse of a different color. He has plus raw power, though he hasn't typically hit for it in games for various reasons. In college, his first broken hamate likely masked his thump and was part of the reason he fell to the 2016 draft's third round. He had the second hamate break in pro ball and his swing is also very compact, relying on Murphy's raw strength rather than efficient biomechanical movement to deliver extra-bases. He could be an above-average regular early on but I think there will be a little attrition over time, so I slid him back behind some players who I think have a higher long-term ceiling.","tVv3ORj53mQ","19352"

He was also demoted from the Northwest League back to the AZL in 2017 for reasons apparently unrelated to performance. The following spring, not only was Duran's velocity more stable -- in the 93-96 range -- but he was throwing strikes and had more consistent secondary stuff. 
Duran continued to fill out into 2019 and his velocity kept climbing, settling in the upper-90s and cresting 100. He worked with better angle after the Twins acquired him last summer, a change that improved the playability of his breaking ball without detracting from his changeup's movement, though that pitch has been de-emphasized based on our sources' looks.

White is more often finishing with a flexed front leg now, which has helped him go down and lift balls in the bottom part of the strike zone by adjusting his lower half instead of his hands. The power output improved and is supported by the measurable underlying data.

Thanks to his athleticism, Gray repeats, and throws more strikes than is typical for someone fairly new to pitching who has this kind of stuff, with a notable proclivity for locating his fastball to his arm side. 
The slider can slurve out and even get kind of short and cuttery at times, but when it's well-located and Gray is on top of the ball, it’s a plus pitch. His changeup, which he seldom uses at the moment, is easy to identify out of the hand due to arm deceleration, and is comfortably below average. 
Because the strike throwing, fastball efficacy, and ability to spin the breaking ball give him a good shot to play a big league role, I've moved Gray up beyond where Kiley and I had him pre-draft.

He's well-conditioned, but short, built narrowly, and likely to max out with a frame (and skill set) similar to Brett Gardner's. 
He lets balls travel deep into the hitting zone and sprays hard contact all over the field -- about half of his extra-base hits were stuck to the opposite field last year, many of them doubles sliced into the left field corner. An unchanged approach to contact would likely result in limited over-the-fence power, but Thomas is fleet of foot and either projects in center field or, due to arm strength, as a plus-plus left fielder, which takes some pressure off the offense. There's some tweener/fourth outfielder risk here but Thomas now has a four-year track record of hitting against pitching that is often older than he is, beginning with his performance on the showcase circuit as an underclassman and ending with an aggressive promotion to Hi-A toward the end of 2019.

He throws strikes with four pitches, several of which either project to miss bats or do so right now. Chief among them is his fastball, which is tough for hitters to pick up out of Balazovic's hand as they're misdirected by his limbs flying all over the place during the delivery. Even with a somewhat lower arm slot, Balazovic's heater plays at the top of the zone. He can vary the shape of his breaking balls -- the slider is the out pitch, the curveball gets dropped in for strikes -- and both play up against righties because of the mechanics. And while Balazovic's glove-side slider command should be enough for him to deal with lefties eventually anyway, his change improved in 2019. He throws an unusually high number of strikes for such a young, lanky, cold-weather arm with a somewhat violent delivery, and he's had no health or control issues thus far.

Then in March, Adams had a coming out party at the heavily-scouted NHSI tournament near his high school. Multiple scouts from all 30 teams watched him against strong competition for a few days, and he looked very, very good, much more comfortable than expected given his level of experience.

He didn't play much during that first pro summer, but the Angels surprisingly skipped him over the Pioneer League and sent him right to full-season ball, even though he'd only been solely focused on baseball for a year. Adams had a slightly above-average statline there, which is incredible for someone who only just picked up a bat.

He'll also work an upper-80s slider to his glove side and it has shocking, horizontal length considering Gonsonlin's arm slot. But the headline offering here is the changeup, a split-action cambio that bottoms out as it reaches the plate. Gonsolin uses it against both left- and right-handed hitters and it's one of the best changeups in the minors.

So confident is Perdomo in his notion of the strike zone that, after taking a looking strike three during Fall League, he flipped off the TrackMan unit calling balls at Salt River Fields. 
That skill combined with Perdomo's bat-to-ball ability from the left side (his right-handed swing is bad) and his elegant shortstop defense, gave him a promising foundation of skills as a teenager on the backfields.

It also made us worry we were too high on Sanchez himself. We, and much of the industry, are scared of corner-only prospects who clearly lack plate discipline, and Sanchez is one of these (6.5% career walk rate). That, plus Sanchez's swing still not being fully actualized for power (a seven degree launch angle in 2019, a groundball rate around 50%), means he's fighting an uphill battle to get to his huge raw power in games, since he's either swinging at pitches he can't do anything with or failing to lift a lot of the ones he can.

The other is the thoroughly modern ""vertical slot/backspin"" box typical of starters whose fastballs I'm more confident in. But this is not a vanilla, three-quarters slot. Rodriguez is well below that, and his upright, short-armed, slingy arm action presents almost a side arm look. It's unique, and creates an awful lot of tail on his fastball. Sitting 92-95, up to 98, and weaponized by Rodriguez's advanced east/west command, it's a potential plus pitch. A split-action changeup is currently his best secondary, while his slow curveball lacks sharp-looking movement but has plus raw spin. 
I think a fully-formed Rodriguez has a different breaking ball than this one, so in this instance I'm making an abstract projection based on Yerry's talent for spinning the baseball. He needs something he can work inside on lefties, either a cutter or a more traditional breaking ball with better back foot angle. From a performance standpoint, Rodriguez has 167 K and 29 BB over the 136.2 innings he's thrown the last two years. He has the best combination of stuff and pitchability in the system.","8-2tF4ZEJGw","sa918130"

We have one here in Liover Peguero, who is a Jean Segura starter kit. His sloped shoulders, short torso, and the high, thick butt and thighs map to a slightly taller version of Segura. More significantly, like Segura, Peguero is remarkably short back to the baseball; his barrel enters the hitting zone in the blink of an eye, giving him an extra beat to decide whether or not to swing. It also makes it hard for pitchers to beat him with velocity, since he's rarely late on anything and has quick enough hands to get on top of pitches near the top of the strike zone. He's also remarkably strong in the hands and wrists for a teenager and is already producing average exit velos above the big league average, though Peguero cuts down at the ball and is currently groundball prone. His swing may get longer as his attack angle changes. 
Perhaps the place where the Segura and Peguero Venn Diagram does not overlap is on the defensive end of things. Peguero is a plus athlete with above-average hands and arm strength, which could make him an above-average defender at short in time. If his lower half thickens and Peguero slows down, he'll look more like Segura does now on defense.","kBYfk4hzOdY","sa3005582"

The eerie shadow of the LF/DH projection (he's had issues throwing to first base) has loomed around Mountcastle's profile for a while now, but he keeps hitting enough for me to like him anyway. 
Mountcastle's timing is sublime, and he has one of the more picturesque righty swings in all of pro baseball, featuring a big, slow leg kick that eventually ignites his deft, explosive hands. He has great plate coverage and hits with power to all fields. Mountcastle swings a lot: He has a 4.5% career walk rate, and it's rare for DH/LF sorts to walk that little and be star-level performers. DH types with OBPs in the .310-.320 range typically max out in the 2-3 WAR range, which is where I expect Mountcastle to peak.

I prefer his changeup and curveball to the bat-missing weapons of other arms in Kansas City's system (Jackson Kowar has a great change and throws a heavy sinker that doesn't miss bats, while Brady Singer is a sinker/command guy) and think Bubic will be a No. 4.","Yy1pUfroMeg","sa3008128"

It led to some bad outings, including one at South Carolina where he allowed 11 runs. 
But 2019 was different. Rolison not only threw a greater percentage of strikes (65%) but he located his four-seam fastball where it plays best -- at the top of the zone. After holding his college velo early in the year, it dipped late in the season but still competes for swings and misses because of its ride. There's also more coherent pitch usage and a better pitch mix now; Rolison has a two-seamer, threw more changeups last year, and was just generally more mechanically consistent.

At that time, it appeared Brusdar had a frontline starter future. He was sitting 96-99, touching 100, his slider was already very good, and he had started to develop changeup feel. Graterol thickened considerably during this stretch and is now listed at 265 pounds after he signed at 170. This, combined with some release point variance and injury hiccups (three IL stints in the last year and a half, including some shoulder stuff), have led to relief risk in the eyes of some clubs. Indeed the Twins put Brusdar in the bullpen late in the year and had publicly declared their intent to put him there again this season before they traded him to the Dodgers (after initially sending him to the Red Sox) as part of the Mookie Betts musical chairs deal. 
He de-emphasized the changeup during his 2019 relief stretch, but of course he may be subject to more tweaks with his new org. I think the slider command gives him a puncher's chance to start even with a limited repertoire, but I think he winds up in high-leverage relief.","5VxhHnSA2hg","20367"

There's some doubt about it playing in pro ball the way it has in college both because it's a slower pitch in the mid-70s and because its huge arc is easy to see out of his hand. Righty batters can wait forever before making a decision against the curveball but it's still been tough for college bats to touch because it has such cartoonish depth. He also works his heater in on the hands of righties and can run it off their hip and back into the zone for looking strikes. That approach with those two pitches has largely enabled Detmers to strike out 284 hitters in 191 career innings. He's a higher variance prospect than is typical for a college pitcher who has performed like this, because even if you buy that Detmers' fastball and curveball will play in the big leagues he needs a clearer third pitch, which will probably be a changeup. I'm a little more skeptical than what I perceive the industry median to be, but still think Detmers has a better chance to start or has been healthier than the other college ptchers in this tier.","mk06YYkpDQk",

A lot of teams thought he was just going to be a reliever. The Astros popped him in the second round of the 2017 draft, hoping to tease out the traits they saw on the Cape, and in the two years he was in the org, they did it. Martin was a top 100 prospect before his elbow blew out late last June.
Healthy Martin sits in the mid-90s, mixes in a hard, upper-80s slider, has an above-average power changeup, a more vertically-oriented curveball, and average command. He made too many mistakes during his short big league look in Houston last year and gave up a bunch of dingers, but we think he'll get his pitch execution issues ironed out and attack hitters the way most Houston arms do: fastballs at the top of the zone, sliders off the plate to the glove side, and changeups and curveballs down. Martin was part of Arizona's return for Zack Greinke. We've diluted his FV a bit because we worry the timing of his surgery will mean he misses most of 2020, though Martin is a premium athlete and animalistic competitor, and people in his current and former org expect him to crush his rehab and be back as soon as possible.

He then reclassified and was suddenly on track to graduate and be draft eligible a year early, meaning every decision-making amateur evaluator in the country had to get in quickly to see a pitcher who had all this new velocity but with whom scouts had very little history. Then Bukauskas asked not to be drafted (he was, but late, and didn't sign) so he could go to North Carolina. After a middling freshman year, he was dominant as a sophomore and in the early part of his junior year before his stuff was depressed during North Carolina's postseason games. That dip inflamed perviously held concerns that durability issues resulting from his size and a violent delivery might push Bukauskas to the bullpen. 
A 2018 car accident, which caused a slipped disk in his thoracic spine, limited Bukauskas to about 60 innings in 2018, which left questions about his ability to start unanswered. He was electric when he returned, though, and became increasingly dominant towards the end of the summer before his stuff was seen by the entire industry in the Arizona Fall League. He flashed 70-grade changeups and sliders on occasion, bumped 98, and has added a cutter, which it appears he has since scrapped.

He was up to 94 for Eric in the AZL after he signed. It will depend on how Walston develops physically, and how those gains counterbalance the coming full-season workload, but he has a chance to end up with three plus pitches and impact command.

Matos isn't a huge-framed outfielder but he projects for plus raw power at peak anyway, because of his ability to rotate.

That's close to the league-average line for outfielders, so why not include Johnson on the top 100? His relative lack of defensive instincts make him more of a fit in right field than in center and I think big league arms will be able to pitch to him in a way that limits his power output below the corner outfield average. His line may be elevated by Cleveland's propensity for platooning, which would limit his role/output from a volume standpoint.

Pages' average launch angle in 2019 was a whopping 25 degrees, which would be the highest among major league players (Rhys Hoskins' averaged an angle of 24 degrees last year) and was in the top five across all of pro baseball last year. 
As you would probably expect for a hitter with such a steep swing, Pages strikes out quite a bit. His speed and defensive instincts give him a chance to stay in center field, though, which gives Pages a little more margin for error as a hitter. If he stays in center, he has a star-level ceiling. If not, then he has a whiff-prone, traditional right field profile. Even if the latter occurs, it's very likely Pages not only gets to all of his raw power but that he might outhit it because of how often he's able to lift the baseball.

More impressive still, though perhaps not surprising, was that Naylor responded and performed, slashing .243/.313/.421 (good for a 110 wRC+) while dealing with the physical toll of catching 80 games. 
Not only has Naylor kept his body in check as a pro (Bo's older brother, Josh, is a bigger guy who is limited on defense, and the amateur side of the industry was somewhat worried Bo might develop in a similar fashion), he's actually more sculpted and athletic now than he was in high school, and he's likely to catch, if unspectacularly, long-term. So long as that remains true, Naylor has a good chance to be an everyday player. His swing's a little grooved, but it is electric and produces big power for anyone, let alone a catcher. If he gets to most of it in games, and he has so far (he had strong amateur statistical performance, as well), there's plenty of room for him to profile even if he ends up as a 40 bat, which I think is possible considering the lack of barrel variability.","4SxNI1qCt10","sa3008247"

It's necessary progress for a player who began a long-anticipated fall down the defensive spectrum, and will likely continue to do so. Vilade began seeing time at third base in 2019, and was taking reps in the outfield during the Rockies' fall workouts. He looked noticeably bigger and stronger on the Salt River backfields than he did during the summer, and we now anticipate Vilade will branch out and play both outfield and infield corners, which makes sense considering how entrenched Nolan Arenado is at third base.

The Red Sox hit the accelerator on his development early (a common occurrence in this system) and sent Mata right to full season ball in 2017 when he was just 18-years old. That gives context to Mata's 2018 struggles; he couldn't throw strikes (he had a 17% walk rate), his stuff was up and down throughout the year, and he dealt with a back injury. Several of those things improved in 2019. More purposeful deployment of a robust, four-pitch mix dropped Mata's walk rate to an acceptable 9%, and his stuff was more consistent even though he missed a month with a shoulder strain. And that stuff? A sinker up to 99 (it won't miss bats, but it's tough to square up), a two-plane breaking ball that he'll throw for strike one or as a putaway pitch, a changeup with movement that mirrors the sinker, and a cutter/slider that Mata is still in the early stages of harnessing. 
Because the fastball is more of a sinker, secondary execution and command will be necessary for him to miss as many bats as possible, and there are forces opposing one another when it comes to projecting his command. On the one hand, he's only 20 and has huge stuff. On the other, he's at best a fringe athlete, and has a relieverish delivery.

He is one of the more talented offensive catching prospects in the minors thanks to a potent combination of power and barrel feel. When Feliciano puts balls in play, they're very often scorched -- just under 50% of the balls he hit last year entered play at 95 mph or above, which is a 65 on the 20-80 scale if you curve out big leaguers' hard hit rates. All of that seems likely to be hampered by Feliciano's hedonistic approach. The dude likes to swing, and has only walked at a 6% clip as a pro. 
Scouts also have tepid opinions about his defense, but let's remember that he's essentially a JUCO-aged player who missed a year of development due to injury. I anticipate some defensive improvement, and think we'll have a electronic strike zone a year or two after Feliciano hits the 40-man, which will help him stay back there. His approach is kind of scary and there's a chance his contact profile bottoms out against big league pitchers who prey on his swing-happy nature, but I have Feliciano evaluated as an everyday catcher based on how much power I think he'll hit for, even if he's running OBPs close to .310.","D6SDMu7h_Q","sa917954"

The swing changes Mitchell made at UCLA are perhaps evidence he can make more as a pro, but I think this gap approach works fine and is best depoyed by sprinters like Mitchell, who has retained his plus-plus speed despite bulking up quite a bit since high school.

His speed and center field defense are both excellent, which creates a floor of sorts, but scout opinions regarding how much Taveras will hit have varied and, more and more, are diverging from stat-based analysis when they're favorable. I think Leody has above-average feel for contact as a left-handed hitter and that his right-handed swing is almost unusable.

Howard best squares up pitches at the bottom of the strike zone, and although he hasn't been tested regularly at the letters, he's shown flashes of being able to either lay off those pitches, or pull his hands in and find a way to get the barrel there, and even to catch that high pitch way out in front of the plate and hit it in the air to his pull side.

Running is simple to evaluate using home to first times, but there's even disagreement over Toro in this area. But let's start with the most important stuff: the offense. Toro is short-levered and tightly-wound, not the loose, rotational athlete most scouts like. But he muscles balls into both gaps and has solid barrel control, enough to spoil tough pitches and grind out tough at-bats. It's a pretty well-rounded contact/doubles power/OBP profile even though Toro presents an atypical look. 
The same is true of Toro's defense. When he has the time to really step into a throw, he uncorks rockets, but he's not the kind of athlete who can make strong throws in tough situations. He's okay at third base, but there are teams and individual scouts who prefer him at either first or in the outfield corners, and some are really intrigued by the latter possibility because of Toro's long speed. He's not a graceful runner, but he can really move once he gets going and his swing has a natural jailbreak, so he's fast to first. A diverse defensive role seems logical considering how crowded Houston's 1B/3B situation is, unless Toro gets traded. He has a shot to be an average everyday player if he gets an opportunity, but otherwise should play a valuable, switch-hitting corner role.","yd1p1EpIUrE","19844"

The Twins, along with a growing number of other orgs, have their catchers set up on one knee (some have their receivers ditch it with two strikes, others don't), which seems to affect how many called strikes they steal, at least in the minors. 
Jeffers spent most of his first full pro season at Hi-A Fort Myers (120 wRC+) and had a strong final month at Double-A Pensacola. He has average bat-to-balls skills, above-average thump, and the ability to hit the ball in the air consistently.

He's been shut down an awful lot. Last year, after just three starts, a shoulder issue sent him to the 60-day IL. It was Morejon's fourth IL stint in the last two years, and he was later scratched from a Fall League start for back tightness. He pitched in relief upon return, which changes the context for the velo. A few other nits. Morejon babies his breaking ball into the zone, and his arm speed changes in a way I think is noticeable. From a spin axis/efficiency standpoint, his fastball is the sinking type that tends not to miss bats, which is part of why I think he's been hittable in a small big league sample, including a nuclear spring outing in Peoria that he followed (and rectified) with a bat-breaking clinic in Tempe against the Angels' varsity squad. Some of this seems imminently correctable, especially considering Morejon's age, but the way the injury history interacts with his relief risk and the fastball traits put him in the 45+ FV bucket with a bunch of other guys with mid-rotation ceilings who I'm scared to really bet on.","yM_8rrMBHNU","20039"

Negotiations broke down, one of several times a high school pitcher has been at odds with an org run by current Braves GM Alex Anthopolous, and Singer went to Florida. After an uneven but promising freshman year in the bullpen, Singer's command improved and he carved up SEC lineups for the next two years. 
His stuff and delivery don't have the look of a dominant, whiff-getting major league starter, at least not at the moment. He has a lower, three-quarters delivery that helps create long tail on his two-seamer, but the pitch only resides in the 91-94 mph area, a 45 raw velocity that I think plays a bit better because of the movement. His low-80s slurve/slider (when it's down below hitters' knees it has more length) gets buffed by Singer's command and also plays up above its raw quality. Singer is a spiky competitor who goes right at hitters and at times has demonstrative body language when he's frustrated with umpires, which are generally traits the industry likes. On talent, he's a No. 4/5 type of starter for me, and any change to that will be determined by how Singer's changeup, which he barely used in college, develops in pro ball. The (+) designation on Singer's FV comes from his track record of durability, and his potential to eat a ton of innings and have a higher WAR output than you'd think given his stuff alone.","cdTk2Lmfb70","25377"

It was surprising then that Peña arrived for his first fall instructional league looking like an NFL cornerback, with one source going so far as to tell me they think Peña has a big league body right now. 
Even though his swing is a bit clunky, and his footwork is perhaps unnecessarily conservative, Peña looked pretty comfortable against pro pitching in the fall, the best pitching he's ever faced in his life to this point; his performance included him roping a single off of Michael Kopech, who was sitting 97 that day. The surprising physicality has already brought about more power and bat speed, and Peña already has the helicopter overhead finish to his swing à la Miguel Andújar and Wander Franco. Once the industry becomes more confident in grading his defense and bat, which will come once he's faced pro pitching for an extended period of time, he could be a global top 50 prospect based on his place on the defensive spectrum and the hit/power combination.","fYcFn23SsMI",

That was the question put to me about Kowar by a source for this list. On some level, they're right. Like Paddack, Kowar has a prototypical frame, he throws in the mid-90s, and has a dominant changeup. What we now know about how and why fastballs play, however, creates some separation between the two. Though Kowar has premium starter fastball velocity, the pitch has tailing/sinking action rather than Paddack-style carry and ride, which means it's going to generate groundballs more than it will miss bats. 
Kowar's breaking ball was comfortably below average in college but the Royals have found a way to add raw spin since acquiring him (his rates are up from 2150 rpm to 2400, still shy of big league average but an encouraging development), and it's closer to average now. He'll likely rely on the element of surprise and his ability to locate it in order to be effective. This is all very similar to how Luke Weaver's reports read coming out of Florida State, and I expect Kowar to have a similar career. He's a 23-year-old who's thrown half a season above A-ball, so while I think he'll be a 50 FV eventually, there needs to be a little gap between him and someone like him who's ready for the big leagues right now.","6Gnu6dq3LLQ","sa3008273"

As is typical for hitters coming back from that injury, Isbel's numbers were poor -- .216/.282/.361 overall at Wilmington -- and improved the further away from surgery he got, culminating in a strong back half of August and Fall League; his Fall League look especially assuaged concerns. 
Isbel has a compact swing (he's a shorter-levered guy) with line drive plane. It's geared to do most of its big damage to his pull side, but he can slice extra-base contact down the left field line and into the left-center field gap. Isbel is still relatively new to playing the outfield full-time, which gives him some late projection on the defensive end. I think he'll be easily supplanted by a superior defensive center fielder but will be a plus corner defender long-term, and I'm intrigued by the idea of him playing a situational second base since he has some experience there, too.

A player's age relative to his peers is a predictive variable for pro success (younger is better) and Baty is older than a lot of 2018's high school draftees, against whom we had pro performance to judge while Baty only had high school stats on draft day. 
Baty compares quite closely to Cardinals 2018 first rounder and top 100 prospect Nolan Gorman: he's big, strong, and has huge power and advanced feel to hit. He may not be an athletic fit at third base, especially long-term, and is at risk of moving to first, but his quicker-than-expected feet (he's a standout hoops player as well) could help delay that.

The closest comp I could find from a height/weight standpoint is José Molina, who was listed at 6-feet, 250 pounds late in his career. Molina was nearly 40 then, while Kirk -- 5-foot-8, 265 pounds -- is only 21, and it's hard to predict what will happen to his build and agility as he ages into his 20s, because pro athletes like this (John Daly, maybe?) don't really exist. 
His age makes the statistical track record even more impressive, though, especially when you consider that Kirk missed a year due to a hand injury and has been young for every level at which he's raked. He has an all-fields, doubles-oriented approach that prioritizes contact and walks. He's a 20-grade waddler from base to base, and even visual evaluations of his swing (which features conservative footwork) are mixed despite his numbers. He can turn on balls in and hit balls hard the other way, but this isn't like Andrew Vaughn, who scouts will acknowledge has defensive limitations and whose mobility they'll knock, but about whose athleticism in the batter's box they all rave. This is a weird one, perhaps a prospect who will be aided by coming changes to the way balls and strikes are called in the event that he begins a physical regression very early, as most scouts believe he will.",,"sa3005337"

That's a 4% walk rate, and in Kirby's most recent calendar year of innings, it has been a microscopic 1.3%. While his pre-draft velocity was strong (touching 97, often 93-95 early, 91-94 late in starts), his secondary stuff was very average. His slider and curveball (the latter is better) ran together a bit, and his changeup had inconsistent finish. But often, elite command of what is a 55-grade pitch in a vacuum leads to elite results (see: Bieber, Shane), and I think that sort of secondary pitch effectiveness is possible for Kirby. 
One of Seattle's stated post-draft goals for the right-hander was to make him stronger. In 2020 spring bullpens, Kirby looked noticeably thicker and stronger, and he is indeed throwing harder, touching 99 mph several times in Peoria side sessions. Logan Gilbert threw very hard in a similar setting the year before, and though his in-season velo band was beneath his pre-season bullpens, he was still above the prior year's range. The difference is the obvious change in Kirby's body. I expect something similar to Gilbert's trajectory here (and for Juan Then, who appears later on this list and was also throwing much harder in the spring before baseball shut down). Even with fairly vanilla secondary stuff, mid-90s heat and Kirby's potential for elite command gives him a mid-rotation ceiling.",,"sa3011526"

He was a bigger, more physical signee than is typical for the international market, the sort most teams would not hesitate to debut in domestic rookie ball. And like Rodriguez, the Mariners allowed Marte to spend his first pro summer dominating competition that simply didn't challenge him (the average DSL fastball velo last year was 88 mph), which led to a .309/.371/.511 line. Marte had a chance to earn an aggressive assignment with a great 2020 spring (probably not Low-A, but perhaps a summer Northwest League placement), putting him on a relative fast track for a teenage hitter, though like the rest of baseball, that possibility in now on hold. 
From an individual tools and skills perspective, Marte's peers are elite high school players. As an amateur, there was uncertainty surrounding his hands, actions, and general ability to stay on the infield, but pro looks have been more favorable, backed by enough arm strength to hide potential future range deficiencies. My previous research into shortstop size has shown that most teenage prospects gain about 30 pounds between when they're 18 and 21 years old, which puts Marte's baseline body projection in the Willy Adames/Trevor Story realm, or about 210 pounds. So long as his hands have indeed improved, that's a pretty favorable comp for his body/range-based fit at short. It means there's Goldilocks Zone power/defensive spectrum potential here, as Marte already has 50-grade raw power at age 18 and will probably have at least a full grade more at maturity. His TrackMan power metrics (they're over on The Board) are in the 40/45 range right now because Marte's swing elements are not always well-timed. They are, however, very athletic. The big leg kick (which Marte is balanced enough to utilize), the little bit of bat wrap to create some loop and lift, and the ability to move the barrel around the zone are all encouraging swing elements, but we really don't know a lot about Marte's bat-to-ball skills right now because he just hasn't faced good pitching yet. There's clearly huge ceiling here and I have Marte in the same FV tier Zac Veen, my highest-ranked prep amateur right now.","24XWJlBKDh0","sa3008745"

His final eight starts were incredible: 45 innings, 63 strikeouts, and just 15 walks. 60% of those pitches were strikes. Mixed into the back half of his season were still some clunky four and five walk outings, so is this trend a sign of things to come or just a blip in a sample too small to trust? 
Medina's stuff is fantastic and has been for a while. He was up to 96 mph as a 15-year-old amateur, eventually going unsigned on July 2nd due in part to his horrendous command. Then he hit 100 mph as an amateur with improved feel, which is when the Yankee scooped him up for $300,000. He still sits 94-98, has hit 101 mph, has a dominant power curveball that's projects as a plus-plus pitch, and his sinking changeup moves enough to miss bats when it's located competitively. The highest walk rates among qualified big league starters are in the 9-11% range, which is where Medina's walk rates were during the second half of 2019. Reds righty Luis Castillo (10%) is a dominant, two-pitch template for Medina's projected ceiling, and unless he once again becomes prone to nuclear strike-throwing meltdowns, his stuff will play in high-leverage relief.","CULpv2BOf-0","sa928510"

He struggled when he returned, and had an OBP just beneath .300 across 74 Hi-A games, whiffing 33% of the time. It's correct to be weary of Florial because of the strikeouts and injuries -- despite having the physical ability of a top 10 overall prospect, Florial has existed in the 45-50 FV tiers his entire pro career because of the K's -- but it's too early to be dismissive of or fatigued by his stagnant development. He's still just 22 and over the course of 140 games at Hi-A as a 20- and 21-year-old, Florial's .250/.330/.380 line is actually above the Florida State League average. 
And he seems to have done at least some of that while undergoing a swing change. Florial's older swing was stiff-wristed (I'm unsure if it had to do with, or was because of, the injuries) and long, and he was often beaten by fastballs near the top of the strike zone and and swung well inside on soft stuff away from him. His newer swing enables him to get around pitches better and his groundball rate dropped for the second straight season last year. What's more, his minor league spray chart, per Baseball Savant, showed less contact peppering the shortstop area and third base line. His TrackMan data indicates the strength and power were intact coming off of the wrist injury. All of this is evidence that Florial remains a talented work in progress capable of making adjustments, which he clearly needs to continue doing.","mYK2ssfvC80","sa874464"

Rutledge has some of the best stuff on Earth, working 96--100 in most outings and mixing in a 65- or 70-grade slider with a curveball a notch below that. His changeup flashes average but is clearly a fourth option, and his command flashes average at times, but should always be somewhat of an issue given his size. Refining the command to be good enough to let his stuff work over long outings is the main development issue here, but it's worth noting that some clubs were scared off of Rutledge's medical in the draft, which most notably included surgery on his hip. This could go down the ""no one can throw that hard, be that big, and be a healthy 200-inning starter"" road, and see Rutledge become a potential closer, or the ""how did anyone pass on this offensive lineman with Syndergaard's stuff"" path, and get immediate whoopsies from the industry, much like Nate Pearson has so far.

Toribio's power and feel to hit -- he has some head violence when he takes big cuts, but still generates a loud, heavy thwack when his swing is more controlled and precise -- means he might profile at first base should he have to move. We don't expect much more raw power to come because he is already so physically mature. We're going to monitor his platoon splits over the next year because, to the eye, he's much less adept at picking up lefty stuff, perhaps concerningly so, but there's not nearly enough data to support that yet.

He seemed to be on the big league fast track when the Red Sox asked him to play center field that fall, but it took two trades and year of rehab from a torn ACL before he finally cracked a big league lineup. First sent from Boston (which signed him) to Milwaukee along with Travis Shaw as part of a lopsided package for Tyler Thornburg, Dubon was traded to San Francisco last summer in exchange for Drew Pomeranz. 
Most of Dubon's role is tied to his ability to make contact, a skill derived from strong hand-eye coordination and bat control. His formerly slender, willowy frame has filled out some, and in 2018 Dubon stopped scrubbing his leg kick with two strikes, but he's still not getting much out of his lower half and his contact quality is entirely dependent on barrel accuracy, which will limit him to doubles power. Defensively, Dubon is passable at shortstop and second base. Ideally, in a reserve role, he'd be able to play center field as well, but aside from the five games he played there in 2016, he's only ever played the middle infield. His home-to-first times were down a bit last year coming off the ACL injury, so either the top-end speed he once had (we've had a 6 on Dubon's wheels each of the last several years, until now) will return, or he'll need to show immediate feel for center for him to see big league reps there.

Hoese was the 2019 case. After putting up an .803 OPS in his draft-eligible sophomore year (he went in the 35th round and didn't sign), he put up a 1.276 OPS in his junior year, with 23 homers and a 38:30 BB/K ratio. He was handled with care by the Dodgers after he signed, spending a lot of time in the AZL and DH'ing due to wrist and forearm tendinitis. He dealt with more wrist trouble this spring and had just been totally cleared and begun throwing to bases a week before the shutdown. 
Hoese's exit velo data was way down in pro ball, something I'm dismissing because of the injury and therefore excluding from The Board (his college avg/max was 88/104, pro was 84/100). He's not tooled up and doesn't have huge raw power or bat speed, even with a healthy wrist. Instead he's a very athletic swinger whose swing is geared for airborne contact. That should help him get to power in games even though there's not huge raw.

Perhaps Torres' control is behind because, as a cold-weather amateur prospect, he hasn't pitched all that much. He only threw around 40 innings during his senior spring, and bad suburban high school hitters in New York couldn't catch his fastball. As a result, Torres had little cause to use his changeup during varsity play -- some national evaluators would go whole starts without seeing it -- but it flashed 55 or 60 during his showcase summer and was easy to dream on. 
Perhaps the most striking aspect of Torres' post-draft performance was how regularly he located his slider down and to his glove side.

He played mostly first in his brief Fall League jaunt and looked bad there, but it was after he had not seen in-game reps for a couple of months, and I think that context is important. 
Los Angeles' plan is to start Busch at second base most the time, but even if he proves passable there with time, he probably won't play there exclusively as a big leaguer. He's more likely to be a bat the Dodgers move around depending on matchups the way they do with Max Muncy.

It was his second straight injury-riddled campaign, as he missed the spring of 2018 with upper back issues, and performed beneath career norms when he returned (33% K% from 2015-'17, 24% in '18), though in fairness to him, he was a 19-year-old pitching at Double-A for the first time. There was pre-draft consternation regarding McKenzie's frame, which, much like Kevin Durant's coming out of Texas, was so lean that it existed somewhere between ""projectable"" and ""concerningly thin,"" causing some scouts/teams to worry about durability. 
In the five years since he was drafted, McKenzie has added five pounds of reported weight (he was listed at 160 on draft day, and is now 165); his fastball, at peak, was 90-93, touching 95 (88-92 in high school) and was 90-94 in camp this spring before the shutdown. The way his delivery and fastball work -- it's deceptive, creates flat angle at the top of the zone, and really carries -- makes me think it'll play at that velocity, and the same is true of McKenzie's curveball, which has good depth depite bad spin rates. He needs to find a third pitch, and hasn't really had a chance to do that for two years because of the injuries. At this point, I think it's more likely to be a slider/cutter than a changeup, which I think would be further along now if it were going to work. 
If he can't find a third pitch, I'm not sure what the role is. McKenzie throws a ton of strikes, so you want him to start, but without a viable third offering that's pretty tough. High-leverage relief types typically have a better two-pitch mix than even a healthy McKenzie does, so a single-inning relief role doesn't seem like a great option, and the bulk relief role is often occupied by lower slot changeup guys, not overhand curveball types.

If that's the case, a change that enables the power is necessary."" In an unsurprising development, the Dodgers did just that. 
Vargas has added a bit of a leg kick and begun hitting the ball in the air a little more often, with his average launch angle moving from 10 degrees to 14. After two and a half months of strong offensive performance at Low-A Great Lakes (where Vargas struggled during a cup of coffee the prior year), he was promoted to Rancho and kept raking. He has terrific hand-eye coordination and bat control, still deriving most of his in-game power from quality of contact rather than big pull and lift. He gets an occasional start at second base but projects to (maybe) play third, and a lot of first.

Cleveland did not baby his innings after he returned from TJ and perhaps 2019 was a bit of a stuff hangover year for him.

He looked a little rusty early during his senior spring, then walked off the mound with tightness in a shoulder muscle tied behind the joint. He returned over a month later and threw hard down the stretch, peaking at 97 mph in multiple open workouts for scouts after his school was eliminated from the playoffs.

They are better demarcated now then when he was an amateur and both flash plus when located. With Hankins' arm slot, the secondary pitch that best mirrors his fastball (which has tailing action because of his slot) is actually the changeup. 
Hankins has gotten a little soft-bodied since signing and I wonder if it has impacted his athleticism and control, but he was also working to tweak his lower half usage to help him get on top of his breaking ball, which might have affected his mechanical consistency last year.

Kaz Matsui and Kosuke Fukudome each had comparable peak power numbers before they came over but Matsui didn’t have Tsutsugo’s ball/strike recognition, and Fukudome was a little bit older and didn’t have this kind of physicality.

It's not even clear whether Pie is going to stay on the infield. He runs well enough that center field is a possibility if his actions don't improve, and he has the arm to play short or third if they do. 
Even if Pie tumbles down the defensive spectrum, it likely means he's grown into substantial raw power, enough to profile at any position. His current tool grade projections indicate what I think things will look like if his frame develops such that it allows him to stay at shortstop, but I think it's going to take a long time before Pie's skillset truly comes into focus.","pROw9MwMoSw","sa3008754"

After three straight years of big time slugging performance, Hernandez's output dipped in the pitcher-friendly Florida State League. Some of this was due to the hitting environment; some of it was due to more advanced pitchers understanding how to attack him to limit damage. Hernandez's swing cuts down through the typical hitting zone and his power is out in front when his swing starts to lift, which makes his point of impact of paramount importance to his power production. There are mixed opinions as to whether this is correctable. While what matters for catchers defensively may soon change, the combo of approach and swing issues have caused me to become more tepid on Hernandez's offensive future.

He has worked with two breaking balls in the past, both of which reside in the low-80s and have enough depth and movement to be considered future average pitches in a vacuum, but they lack raw spin and were consolidated after he signed. They may play better against righties if Goss' delivery proves tough for them to parse.

Scouts who saw Frank in pro ball after the Rays popped him in the second round see a slightly lesser version of Taylor Walls, another under-tooled Rays middle infielder with lots of feel.

Here is the list of qualified 2019 big league hitters with the highest strikeout rates in the majors (all between 27% and 32%), along with their strikeout rates at Double-A: Rougie Odor (16%), Domingo Santana (29%), Ryan McMahon (27%), Eugenio Suarez (20%), Franmil Reyes (23%), Luke Voit (15%), Javy Baez (28%), Yoan Moncada (30%), Jackie Bradley (18%), Khris Davis (19%). Most of these players saw a dramatic increase in strikeouts once they got to the big leagues. Those with sky-high Double-A strikeout rates who have gone on to become star big leaguers are all physical freaks, super-human talents; you can include Miguel Sano and Joey Gallo, who were hurt in 2019 and did not qualify for the list, among them.
Dalbec, whose struggles with whiffs date back to his days in college, struck out 28% of the time at Double-A. That is a strong indication he will probably strike out a ton, probably too much to be an everyday player. But he does have thunderous, all-fields power and he's athletic enough to handle third base despite his considerable size. He's also shown improved patience at the plate. We think all of this will combine to create a viable role player or low-end regular at third base, but we acknowledge there's risk that the hit tool bottoms out.","ZDPCbTYDtRo","sa857701"

He was clearly a first round talent ahead of last year's draft, but it was unclear where he'd be picked because of his military commitment. Currently, service academy policy states Song must complete two years of Naval service. The Trump administration repealed an Obama-era rule that allowed athletes to petition for an exemption in order to pursue pro sports or some other activity that might bolster recruitment or the image of the military in general. Whether this rule is reinstated via executive action will have a significant impact on Song's future. He'll either enter pro ball full-time soon, and perhaps move quickly thanks to the quality of his stuff, or he'll be away from baseball for two years and return when he's nearly 25. 
Song works fast and throws hard. He was up to 99 during Team USA's Premier12 scrimmages in Arizona, his slider is plus, and he will mix in the occasional knee-buckling rainbow curveball. He at least profiles in a high-leverage relief role given the current composition of his stuff and control, and perhaps more than that if he's put into the development pipeline quickly. If not, we can't anticipate what'll happen to his stuff because of the layoff. It's tough to wrangle just how that impacts Song's standing as a prospect even if it doesn't impact his talent as currently constituted.","8izj28iTiyo","sa3011695"

He is a true 80 runner and has a running back build at a physical 5-foot-11, but has little power to his game due to a very simple, opposite-field, slap-oriented approach, especially from the left side. While both swings are concerning for several reasons (bat path, balance, varied lower half use), there is unmistakable feel for contact and impressive hand-eye coordination. Due to the approach and swing, Jimenez's exit velos are low enough to be in a sort of danger zone, and he's not physically projectable. Any hope for impact contact has to come from projection on the swing itself, and Jimenez shows more pop in BP and he hasn't been switch-hitting for very long, so it's possible. 
We don't want to overthink this one, and even though the swing needs polish, this is a plus-plus athlete with what the org thinks is plus-plus makeup, elite speed, and impact defense and arm strength. On top of all this, Jimenez led the college-heavy New York-Penn League in hitting as a 19 year-old primarily hitting left-handed, something he started doing just two years ago in instructional league.

Because he had skipped the KBO's draft to sign with an MLB team, the KBO barred him from signing with any South Korean pro team for two years. When he hit the market again, Bae signed with Pittsburgh for $1.25 million. He was found guilty of and later suspended for assaulting his former girlfriend in an incident that occurred on New Year's Eve 2017. After the suspension and a treatment/education program, Bae returned to the field and was skipped over two levels and sent to full-season ball at age 19, where he hit .323/.403/.430.

Bae's arm may prevent him from playing shortstop, but if that's the case he'll still fit at second base and he has the speed to play center field.

At a compact 6-foot or so, he's unlikely to grow into much thump. Instead, Celestino is a potential everyday player because of his bat-to-ball skills and his center field defense. Celestino was more of an instincts/feel defender as an amateur, but he's sped up as he's grown into his modest frame and projects as a plus glove now. His athleticism is evident not only on defense, but in the batter's box, too, where Celestino stays well balanced during a long, slow leg kick.

The pitching he saw in the AZL was the best he's seen in his entire life, and Head not only allayed concerns about that competition-quality chasm by hitting .283/.383/.417, he also occasionally did some freaky, elite stuff that got me very excited about his prospectdom. Head is ambidextrous, and swings and throws a baseball with his left hand but quarterbacked primarily with his right, occasionally using his left when he rolled out that way. For someone with so little high-level experience, his bat control is remarkable. A pronounced arm bar caused him to be late on some of the good velo I've seen him face but Head's feel for opposite field contact enabled him to strike those pitches with authority anyway. I think he needs polish from a mechanical standpoint, but there's rare natural bat-to-ball proclivity happening here. There's also much more measurable power than I would have guessed -- Head's exit velos last summer were more akin to those of heavy-hitting corner guys his age than someone who looks like a wiry leadoff sort.

The other is that we're still talking about a college-aged player who was pushed through the system quickly, and whose 2019 struggles came at Double-A Amarillo, where Potts was just 20 years old, nearly four year younger than the average Texas League player.

If that's the case, he could have a dominant fastball. He also has a changeup that is plus right now. Not only does it have bat-missing movement but Cantillo's arm speed really sells hitters on the notion that they're getting a fastball; A-ball bats flailed at it in 2019. The carry on his fastball enables Cantillo to compete for swinging strikes in the zone, and that, plus his ability to throw lots of competitively-located changeups mean he can work back into any count.

Hunt also has a contact-oriented approach at the plate, one that's quite conservative (zero leg kick) and doesn't take full advantage of his movement skills.

Several repertoire changes, two trades (and the scrutiny that comes with that), fluctuations in his walk rate, some injuries (most notably shoulder stiffness in 2018), and mixed performance at the upper levels have caused a constant need for re-evaluation. The latest of these many developments is a logical shift, given Sheffield's sinker-friendly arm slot, to a two-seam look on the fastball. Sheffield's 2020 spring velo was parked in the 89-93 range, but now his fastball has more tailing/sinking action, which dovetails very nicely with the shape of his slider. Sheffield will throw a shorter, curt slider in the zone for strikes (one scout source who saw Sheff this spring thought it might be a separate cutter) and a longer, nastier, bat-missing version that finishes out of the strike zone. This pitch is plus, and was used heavily in Sheffield's electric spring outings, especially as a back foot out-pitch to righties. 
Sheffield's changeup is also good, but his arm side command of all his pitches is not, so whether he'll be able to consistently set up the change with well-located fastballs is in doubt. So, too, is Sheffield's ability to eat innings like a traditional starter because of his hot and cold strike throwing.

If you've been reading this year's lists, you know the Southern League offensive environment was very unkind to hitters last season. A source not with Seattle told me that based on his TrackMan/Statcast data, Lewis' Expected SLG%, was about .100 higher than his actual output, with an xSLG up around .500. He averaged 92 mph off the bat last year and hit 53% of balls in play at 95 mph or above (a 70 on the scale); another source whose team tracked Hard Outs among 2019 minor leaguers (balls in play at 95 mph or up that resulted in outs) told me Lewis made more than 40 of them last year, which was in the top 10 in all the minors. On balance, I think Lewis is a 45, a 1.5 WAR player on average during his years of team control. But he has plus-plus, impact power and could get hot and make some All-Star teams during that span, while other years will be quite lean.","XQKmDL-5xqQ","19508"

Perhaps not coincidentally (or perhaps because we were wrong about Raleigh's arm grade last year, when we 55'ed it), reports on Raleigh's arm strength are worse than they were a year ago, though it appears he's a viable, long-term catcher, if an unspectacular one.

Brendan Gawlowski's spring look at Dunn, during which the right-hander sat 92-94 over three innings, is perhaps indicative of the former since Dunn rarely worked with his changeup at a time when most starters are working heavily with their tertiary pitch in preparation for the season. Still, I remain somewhat bullish on Dunn's changeup development. He's had stretches in the past where it's been a plus pitch and it's arguably the best long-term fit with his fastball's tailing/sinking shape. What I'm less optimistic about is Dunn's starter stamina. He looked gassed late last year and while into the mid-90s early, was not throwing as hard in subsequent innings this spring. Ideally his fastball lives in at least the 93-96 mph range out of the bullpen and Dunn can be a dynamic, three-pitch reliever.

The movement profile of his fastball may not be the best for missing bats, but it's likely to be an impact pitch because of the velocity. He could end up with three average secondaries (there's a chance the split becomes better than that) and enough strikes to start, making him a potential No. 4/5 starter or late-inning reliever.","zxleCAlKeXc","sa917588"

When Young connects, he does so with power. Buff and square-shouldered, Young's physicality is a driving component of his power but it's also why he's somewhat limited defensively.

It's an odd athletic trend for someone who was once a decorated amateur swimmer, since swimmers are always ultra sinewy and lean. It is common for baseball players whose bodies mature early to also start to decline early, at least in our anecdotal experience, and this is true of Beer, who was on the scouting radar very early as an old-for-his-grad-year (we really need a word for this) underclassman. Instead of reclassifying and entering the 2015 draft as an 18-year-old, Beer skipped his high school senior year completely and early-enrolled at Clemson. He went on to have one of the best freshman years in college baseball history: .369/.535/.700 with 18 homers, 62 walks, and 27 strikeouts. 
In the few intervening years, Beer has continued to perform, his numbers slowly trending down as he reached his draft year at Clemson, then pro ball for a year with Houston before they shipped him to Arizona as part of the Zack Greinke trade. He's now 23 and has a .294/.388/.508 career line in the minors. He reached Double-A in his first pro season.

Eric saw some average changeups, as well. His fastball control is certainly raw, and while Martinez has a strong, projectable frame, his arm action is somewhat odd, with less external rotation going on than with most elite velo guys. 
The D-backs need to work on getting Martinez behind the baseball so his fastball doesn't have cut action (it's not enough cut to be impactful, it's just running into barrels, as you can see on our high speed video of Martinez) and instead has ride.

To that end, his ability to identify balls and strikes remains undercooked and it has undermined his performance in spite of blaring physical gifts.

In a small spring sample, it appeared to be working -- Arias played some spring games in the place of Fernando Tatis Jr., who was one of several Padres to miss time with flu-like symptoms during the spring (tugs collar) before baseball shut down. The importance of Arias' approach extends beyond his on base ability to his power production. His swing is grooved, making the parts of the zone where he can do real damage limited, so for Arias to get to his power in games he's not only going to have to recognize balls and strikes, but also learn what he can actually hit. It's possible this will occur, and Arias will be a star if it does, but I think an Orlando Arcia trajectory, where there are growing pains and frustration amid flashes of spectacle, is more likely.","QiH28DhFuPI","sa3004047"

He has yet to harness the fastball and throw consistent strikes (he's walking a batter per inning, too) and his breaking ball quality is also inconsistent.

Mercedes ditches the leg kick with two strikes, but he's so strong that he puts balls in play -- hard -- without it. 
His route to the precipice of the big leagues has been scenic. After three years with Washington, Mercedes was cut and spent 2014 in Indy ball, including time in the Pecos League with the White Sands Pupfish. Baltimore signed him and had him for two years before losing him to Chicago in the 2017 minor league Rule 5 Draft. 
Mercedes has now hit his way up the ladder (a .302/.366/.491 career line, including those mediocre years with Washington that brought about his release) and has big league offensive ability -- he just cannot catch. While he presents strikes to umpires well on occasion, he'll also just totally whiffs sometimes and is constantly running to the backstop. Craig Littleman, a former coworker of mine who played for White Sands with Mercedes in 2014, told me even that team was trying to hide him on defense. He also said Mercedes was by far the team's smartest, most talented hitter. I'm not anticipating Mercedes will be able to catch every day once automated strike zones come about, but I do think it gives him a better chance to do so once in a while and that he'll hit enough as a DH/1B to play a part-time role anyway.

Amid these long stretches of inactivity, Adolfo got big and buff (he nows tips the scales at a listed 255 -- as a comical aside, Eloy Jiménez is listed at 205) but also pretty stiff, and while the White Sox have maintained that they'd like him to play the outfield, he's one of several heavy-footed DH types on the 40-man. 
Adolfo has the raw power to clear that (or any) offensive bar, but he's had strikeout issues throughout his career and except for the last few, injury-riddled seasons (small sample alert), he's been a hedonistic free swinger. He's run close to an 11% walk rate in his last 550 plate appearances, which is double the rate he posted from 2014 to 2017. It would give him a better chance of playing a consistent role if that increase in patience is real and sustains. The power gives Adolfo a chance to have some 2019 Jorge Soler type seasons while his whiffs make him a high variance hitter likely to have several replacement-level campaigns as well.

He doesn't have a cut, athletic physique, and his delivery is reliever-y and somewhat stiff, but Hernandez does repeat, and throws a lot of strikes.

I buy that the velo will be there in short stints and that both breaking balls, assuming the slider returns, will be plus. As such, I have Williamson projected as a three-pitch power reliever.","d-9h6aeLO1s","sa3011494"

He'd need to be a plus shortstop defender to profile as a low-end regular, and while he has looked like it at times, it hasn't been consistent, and the Rays began moving him all over the infield late last year.

He was graceful, projectable, and already had average big league stuff almost two years before he was even eligible to be drafted. That stuff just kept improving, peaking the summer before his draft year when Groome would work 92-96 mph in short stints with an easy, plus curveball while folding in an average to above changeup, doing so with a big, athletic frame and starter's delivery, all of which led to him being mentioned as a possible No. 1 overall pick. But a myriad of concerns unrelated to Groome's talent dogged him more than most prep prospects, most of them stemming from an unstable living situation that involved drugs and guns, for which his father was later arrested. That, combined with a quickly thickening frame and issues with his commitment to Vanderbilt, contributed to his fall out of the top 10 picks of the 2016 draft. 
Since signing, Groome hasn't been on the mound much, making just 20 total pro starts due to a back injury and, eventually, Tommy John surgery. He came back from TJ late last August and got four innings of work before instructional league, where he got another eight to 10 frames, working 93-95 two innings at a time. Groome is Rule 5 eligible next winter and he's never thrown more than 55 innings in any of his four pro seasons. Those two things create some pressure and make it likely that the Red Sox either really need to push him next year, creating more risk that he'll get hurt yet again, or that he'll just be bullpen'd to give him a better shot at contributing in 2021.

Brandon Crawford and Dansby Swanson are some of the more notable successes, Jordy Mercer is a middle tier outcome, and Connor Kaiser (Pirates) along with Connor Walsh (Ole Miss) are two in-progress candidates along with Kessinger. Kessinger also has big league bloodlines: his grandfather (Don) played 16 seasons in the big leagues in the 1960s and 70s, his father (Kevin) played a summer of pro ball in 1992, and his uncle (Keith) got a big league cup of coffee in 1993.
Grae stood out on the summer showcase circuit in high school as a glove-first athlete with the tools to succeed offensively but middling performance against top pitching; that mostly held through his three years at Ole Miss, though he made solid progress. Kessinger's approach steadily improved and he got to more of his power, leading to a pro debut at age 21 spent mostly in Low-A, where he performed almost as well as he did in college. His swing complexity and effort were reduced in college to make more contact, and he's a swing change candidate in pro ball, as this type of hitter can benefit from mechanics that free up his athleticism. Kessinger was an above average defender in high school but bulked up a bit in college and lost a bit of quickness.

For now, I think his hands and actions are good enough to continue projecting him as a shift-aided second baseman.

He also isn't classically projectable -- his velocity is already at the top of the scale and he has a maturely-built frame at 6-foot, but he's done some arm slot and arm action tinkering over the last few years that has affected his control and command. So while Gaston may get stronger as he physically matures, what's more important is the projection of his feel for pitching, which appears to be more natural at a three-quarters arm slot with velocity more in the mid-90s, where his arm action is also more naturally online, than the higher slot where he was throwing harder and wilder. 
Gaston's best pitching performance was as the main event on the mound at the Víctor Víctor Mesa workout in Marlins Park, where the better version of his arm slot, arm action, and control was first seen by a large scouting audience. It didn't hold. Gaston walked a batter per inning in his first pro season while sitting in the 93-97 range with the fastball. He's a teenage relief prospect at this point.","PB7HrCsfEUU","sa3011136"
