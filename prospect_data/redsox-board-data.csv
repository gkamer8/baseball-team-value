His hands work in a circle that enables him to turn on and lift pitches down-and-in, and helps him scoop breaking pitches with lift, but also in a way that causes his bat head to drag through the zone a bit. After watching Carter Kieboom struggle with a similar-looking swing, I've begun to wonder if Downs will be tied up by big league velocity in on his hands. But the closer to the bottom of the zone pitches are, the more Downs punishes them with pretty good pop to all fields. He's going to pepper the gaps and do a fair amount of damage to right-center field. 
Last year, I projected Downs to be a second baseman based on how thick his lower body already was at age 21, and there are folks in the industry who still think that's the case, but at the alternate site, I thought he looked agile enough to stay at short and be passable in the same way Xander Bogaerts kind of has been, especially on balls in play to his left and in on the grass. I think Downs can be positioned defensively so that he's making most of his plays in that direction rather than having to go into the hole and backhand balls, which he's less able to do. His average exit velo was 88 mph in 2019, and there's not a lot of room on the body, so that might be all, but he strikes the ball hard and with consistency, and that's typically enough to be an everyday player at one of the middle infield spots. <em>(Alternate site)</em>","613T5IEJ7rk","sa3004615"

Like Votto, he has also played with the depth of his batting stance's crouch; Casas became more upright throughout 2020 and now has a bigger, more athletic move forward in the box. And he does have a pretty advanced approach and ball/strike recognition for someone his age, and also has enough pure strength to hit balls with power even though his approach appears conservative on its face. Because he's such a big guy with long, left tackle arms, his swing does have a hole up-and-in that will be difficult to close. But the overall package is still Top 100-strong even though Casas is a 1B/DH without a long, robust pro statistical track record (his 2019 exit velos are unexceptional) because he looks the part and has an unusually long amateur performance resume. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>","900T_ozI7iY","sa3007634"

Then, in 2019, he posted a very acceptable 9% walk rate in a season split between Hi- and Double-A and capped his year in the Fall League, where he threw really hard (often 97-99) in front of the whole industry. He came to the 2020 alternate site looking svelte, and showing better feel for his firm, short cutter/slider, a pitch he added later in pro ball. 
Mata resides in the 45+ FV tier for several of the same reasons that Adrian Morejon and Justus Sheffield have in the past: the shape of their fastball movement is not suited to missing bats, and they have a spotty command and/or injury track record. Even though Mata sat 93-96 as a starter in 2019, his fastball only generated a 6% swinging strike rate against mid-level hitters. His best two pitches for missing bats are his changeup followed by his well-located slider (the curveball has nastier movement but is an easy ID out of his hand due to its loopier shape). Mata's release grew inconsistent later in his alt site outings and he's not as good of an athlete as the typical starter. I think he'll start for Boston but on a contending team, a guy like this comes out of the bullpen in a valuable multi-inning role. <em>(Alternate site, was on the instructs roster but did not pitch in games)</em>","_xTejFK8I5g","sa917784"

He's now <em>only</em> a 70 runner who has a chance to lead off and play impact defense in center field. 
The news of the added weight and strength is exciting because, while Jimenez was already a 45+ on last year's writeup, he had little in-game power due to a very simple, opposite-field, slap-oriented approach, especially from the left side. There's been a little bit of movement on that score, but scouts still describe his swing as ""handsy"" and unlikely to produce power as it's currently constituted, again, especially from the left side. Both swings were previously concerning for several reasons (bat path, balance, varied lower half use) but it's possible that, even without a mechanical overhaul, Jimenez's increased physicality will enable him to hit for doubles power down both baselines and to the gaps, which would be perfectly suitable for both traditional and modern leadoff man archetypes so long as he has the requisite secondary skills. He has good natural feel for making contact thanks to impressive hand-eye coordination. And again, this is a plus-plus athlete with what the org thinks is plus-plus makeup, elite speed, and impact defense and arm strength. On top of all this, Jimenez led the college-heavy New York-Penn League in hitting as a 19-year-old primarily hitting left-handed, something he started doing just two years ago in Instructional League. He'll likely be on this offseason's Picks to Click and would have been on this offseason's top 100 had he been able to show in games that the body change impacted the power output, or that he has a high-end feel for the strike zone. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em> ",,"sa3005507"

I've updated some of the stuff related to his commitment's timing, but his scouting report is exactly the same: It's fairly common for a prospect's trade value to be affected by something circumstantial, but Song's situation is unique. He was clearly a first round talent ahead of the 2019 draft, but it was unclear where he'd be picked because of his military commitment. At the time, service academy policy stated that Song had to complete two years of Naval service, after the Trump administration repealed an Obama-era rule that allowed athletes to petition for an exemption in order to pursue pro sports or some other activity that might bolster recruitment or the military's image in general. Then, weeks after Song was drafted, the now-outgoing president reinstated the rule, with the exemption slated to take effect again in 2020. But Song's application for a retroactive waiver was denied by the Navy. He is eligible to apply for an early release in May. 
However long it takes, Song still has among the highest ceilings in this system. He works fast and throws hard, up to 99 during Team USA's late-2019 Premier12 scrimmages in Arizona, his slider is plus, and he will mix in the occasional knee-buckling rainbow curveball. He at least profiles in a high-leverage relief role given the current composition of his stuff and control, and perhaps more than that had he been put into the developmental pipeline more quickly. We can't anticipate what'll happen to his stuff because of the layoff. It's tough to wrangle just how that affects Song's standing as a prospect even if it doesn't impact his talent level, which is rare. <em>(At-home dev)</em>","8izj28iTiyo","sa3011695"

He finally made his big league debut in 2020 and worked with a two-seamer, four-seamer and slider across three starts, with his fastballs sitting in the 90-96 mph range. Some folks in baseball think he'll be a Justin Masterson-style starter, and perhaps he'll be put in that role as the Sox rebuild, but on a competitive team, I have Houck projected in a multi-inning relief role, and think his velo could climb to the top of that 90-96 band and touch above it in shorter outings. He started working with a splitter last year, and it showed glimpses of bat-missing bottom at the alternate site (he barely used it in major league games). If that pitches develops, then he'll just be able to start, long-term. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>","QTDQgUJS9H4","19879"

He now starts with a narrower base than before, and his hands are set much lower to start, changes that theoretically create better rotation up through the kinetic chain and natural swing loft, respectively. We won't know if the changes have a substantive impact on Duran's power output until sometime in 2021, as his alt site hitting metrics are meaningless because they were generated against the same mediocre pitchers he saw over and over, but visually, it now appears Duran can better lift pitches in the bottom of the zone. He didn't exactly hit for power in Puerto Rico over the winter, though, and the org thinks it's because his new swing requires more precise timing, which Duran hasn't yet found. 
Still, let's not forget Duran's tools (he's a 70 runner) nor the foundation of statistical performance he has laid dating back to college. Duran hit a career .294 at Long Beach State but produced almost no power and slipped to the seventh round. Then he torched short-season and Low-A ball after signing, and began 2019, his first full pro campaign, with a ridiculous .387/.456/.543 line at Hi-A. But after seeing him at the 2019 Futures Game, I thought there was a gap between his talent level and that of the typical Futures Gamer, to his detriment. He posted a middling Double-A line during the back half of 2019, and he was similarly underwhelming during an extended look in that season's Fall League. 
Despite his speed, Duran's instincts in center field are still not good (though they've improved), and he relies on his speed to make up for what he lacks in off-the-bat feel and anticipation. It's possible the swing change has unlocked the power necessary to make Duran a regular, but it's also possible that it has de-stabilized his feel for contact. We won't know until he's generated a bigger statistical sample with the new cut. I have him in as a fourth or platoon outfielder, a 1.5-ish WAR type of player. <em>(Alternate site, Liga de Béisbol)</em>","L8gFdZbJcrc","sa3006786"

As our own David Laurila learned from Seabold, he only began throwing his goofy, tailing changeup with his current grip/release in 2019, a year when he barely pitched due to an oblique injury. He picked up innings in the Fall League, where he looked a little out of shape but still sat 90-93 and touched 94 (typical for him) before being shut down again after just four outings. Then he threw at the Phillies' alt site in 2020 (publicly on video) before the team traded him and Nick Pivetta for Brandon Workman and Heath Hembree. 
Seabold doesn't throw all that hard but his fastball spins at an usually high rate for its velocity, and the pitch has flat angle and a spin axis commensurate with the modern, up-in-the-zone approach. The heater and the changeup, which has screwball action, are going to give hitters fits. Both of Seabold's breaking balls are visually mediocre but he commands them pretty well, and they aren't easy IDs out of his hand, especially for righty batters. I have him in as a 1.5-ish WAR starter now, and we'll likely see him in the big leagues soon. <em>(Alternate site)</em>",,"sa829464"

Then Mike Zunino signed, and Francisco Mejía was acquired via trade, and now Hernandez is part of a very volatile mix of strikeout-prone catchers with, especially where Mejía and Hernandez are concerned, big defensive questions. If you just look at raw tools, Hernandez compares to Gary Sánchez and is not only a potential everyday catcher but one who might have real impact. He has big raw power and run-stopping, plus-plus arm strength, but his approach is bad (which might impede the power), and his swing only generates power in certain parts of the zone. He loads his hands very high and deep and then cuts down through the typical hitting zone, which causes Hernandez's power to come toward the top of the zone and out in front when his swing starts to lift, making his point of impact of paramount importance to his power production. My crude video analysis of my in-person looks at Hernandez compared to his 2020 spring training and alt site swings show his footwork has changed. He's starting with an open stance and using more of a leg kick than before. If it improves his timing, this change will be important, and I've slid Hernandez up from the 40+ tier based on it. But his defensive ability, specifically the receiving, might still be a problem and is part of why Kevan Smith was ahead of him on last year's depth chart. He's still a high-variance prospect with some flaws that may be exploited in a significant way at the big league level, but Hernandez has a shot to be an everyday player due to his power. Boston acquired Hernandez for pitching depth in February. <em>(Alternate site)</em>","i2Oumgt06Go","sa881850"

He's athletic enough to handle third base despite his considerable size, but Rafael Devers is entrenched at the hot corner, though he isn't great there.

That seems to have happened to Bazardo, whose fastball sat 91-94 in 2019, then was 94-96 and torching hitters in the Fall of 2020, though his stride direction has also changed (he used to land closed and is now more direct to the plate, which has caused him arm slot to lower a bit ad may have altered his fastball movement profile). He was added to the Red Sox 40-man and will likely be part of their bullpen mix in 2021. Bazardo's high-effort delivery and imprecise fastball command both push him to the bullpen, but he may be an impact relief piece because his mid-80s curveball has such ridiculous power and depth. He also has rudimentary feel for creating diving action on a low-90s splitter, though Bazardo doesn't locate it consistently enough for that pitch to be very competitive right now.

He ended up throwing nearly twice as many innings as he had the year before, but rather than show fatigue toward the end of the season, Bello actually had his better starts during the second half of the summer. During those he's bump 98, miss both right- and left-handed bats with his changeup, and flash an occasionally nasty slider. He continued to throw harder in (manicured) Fall 2020 outings, sitting 94-96 (up from 92-95) and touching 98. The movement profile on Bello's fastball is mediocre. It has tail when located to his arm side, and its angle makes it look like it has ride at the top of the zone. His slider occasionally has nasty bite but it's really inconsistent and gets hammered when he doesn't locate it well. Because of the slider's mediocrity and Bello's longer arm action, I currently have him projected in an impact fastball/changeup bullpen role, and he may yet throw harder if that move is made permanently. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3005436"

Groome came back from TJ late in August 2019 and got four innings of work before Instructional League, where he got another eight to 10 frames, working 93-95 two innings at a time. Both his 2020 alternate site stuff (a new slider, improving changeup, his trademark curveball) and conditioning were encouraging and he suddenly looked like a lock to be added to Boston's 40-man and potentially play a role on this year's big league roster. Mechanically, and perhaps this was due to his improved conditioning, Groome did a better job of getting over his front side at the alt site, which is crucial to his fastball control. Then he arrived for instructs again looking soft-bodied and weighing in at a listed 262 pounds. His velocity was down in the upper-80s and low-90s rather than in the low-to-mid 90s. Boston added him to the 40-man anyway, but it's clear a big part of Groome's future depends on his abolity to keep his body in check, which he hasn't done consistently. 
It's frustrating that even after several years of intense interest, there's a lot we don't know about Groome. He's still just 22 and hasn't yet had the opportunity to refine his slider against hitters from other organizations. You can assume some of what we don't know is hidden upside, but certainly most of what we <em>do</em> know is that this is a volatile prospect.

Ward was not invited to the Red Sox alt site and he was on the instructs roster but didn't throw in games there, so I have no new notes on him from this year and his reports remains the same. I think it's fair to interpret his exclusion from the alt site as evidence that I am, along with my sources from last year's write-up, a little too high on Ward, but I don't think that leap in logic is enough to move him yet.

His slider is average but has effective, vertical movement, and he has fairly advanced arm-side changeup feel. An average athlete with a smaller frame, there's no overt physical projection that allows us to get excited about Ramirez growing into a monster fastball, so instead we think he's a developmental fifth starter."" 
Well, Ramirez started throwing harder. He was sitting 92-94 at Instructional League and was topping out at 96 without having lost any command, or having begun to overthrow his breaking ball, or anything of that nature. Changeup/command guys tend to outpace traditional projections and though the developmental setting could have allowed for a short-term velo bump that won't hold over a long season (I have Aldo sitting 90-94 in 2019), Ramirez is still on track to be a pitcher similar to Seabold by the time his 40-man deadline arrives. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3005371"

This describes Yorke, who the Red Sox made their surprising first round pick in 2020, and who is perhaps the most divisive prospect I've had to write up so far this offseason. 
I had a 35+ FV on Yorke, pre-draft. The bulk of my in-person looks came during 2019 PG National and the Area Code Games. During that time, he looked like a polished bat who couldn't play shortstop due to a lack of arm strength, perhaps a lingering effect of a labrum tear from Yorke's sophomore year of high school that caused him to spend his junior year DH'ing and playing the outfield. His infield footwork, hands, and actions were all fine, but the arm strength was not, and if that continues, then at best he'll be able to play second base, which is where I have him projected. That's still a favorable place on the defensive spectrum and Yorke doesn't even have to develop a ton of power to profile there so long as he truly has a plus bat that produces bushels of doubles. Indeed, several amateur scouting departments think he'll easily be able to do that, and even the clubs that didn't pick him think Yorke was one of the, if not <em>the</em>, most polished high school hitters on the West Coast in 2020. 
Pro scouts' looks in the Fall were not as strong. One noted to me that they did not see Yorke pull a ball in the air at all during Instructional League. He showed up to the Red Sox alt site looking a little heavier and less athletic than he did the summer before, which perhaps puts him on a trajectory to be a shift-aided second baseman, but he's still young enough for variability in this regard and I'm told that what he looked like at the alt site was better than how he looked physically earlier in the spring.

Then he blew out his UCL in the middle of 2019 and had surgery. Whitlock began throwing in January of 2020 but was expected to miss most (if not all) of the year and was likely on track to compete for a spot on the Yankees staff in 2021. Several teams tried to slip unscoutable rehabbing pitchers through the Rule 5 draft, but several of them got picked, including Whitlock.

The power comes from strength rather than lift in the swing. Potts' swing path is actually quite flat, and even without his strikeout issues, I think he'd hit for less in-game power than his raw due to lack of lift, though perhaps his new club will be able to coax more out of him. There's bust potential here, just a binary ""no"" on the hit tool, an outcome in the Juan Francisco/Matt Davidson realm.

Then German (Dominican-born and whose name is pronounced like the European country) had one of the latest pre-draft velo spikes possible, suddenly hitting 95 mph during the Atlantic Sun Conference tournament in his final college game just two weeks before the draft. High-velocity fastballs are a dime a dozen these days, but German had the athleticism and arm action of a starter and had put on about 15 pounds in the previous 12 months, so some thought this could be coming. Clubs who had scouts at that final start shot him up their boards, and the Yankees jumped to the front of the line to take him in the fourth round. 
The velo spike held throughout German's first summer in pro ball -- he sat 92-95 and touched 97 mph in the Fall Instructional League, and put on about 10 additional pounds after signing -- and then moved yet another tick in 2019 -- 93-96, touch 98 -- even though German was still starting.

The length of his arm action and the gap between where his secondary stuff is now (German's college breaking ball was scrapped, and his changeup is now his best secondary) and where it'd have to be to play several times through the order means German is likely a fastball-heavy reliever. <em>(At-home dev)</em>",,"sa3007729"

Still relatively crude as a hitter (and I'm always skeptical of physically mature hitters performing in the DSL), Feliz is a leviathan with plus-plus raw power. He'll likely be limited to left field or first base, especially if he somehow gets bigger, which, combined with relatively raw pitch recognition, makes him a prospect of extreme risk. Ordinarily at this stage, that's just a 35 FV guy, but this dude's size and power at his age is rare, in the Luken Baker/Josh Naylor area. <em>(At-home dev)</em>",,"sa3008799"

Most low-slot guys like this have longer arm actions but Wu-Yelland's is really short. His breaking ball is tough on lefties because of his slot, and his changeup flashes average, which is his best secondary in a vacuum. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3014520"
