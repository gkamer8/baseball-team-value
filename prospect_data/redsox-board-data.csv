He's not a shortstop for me and, in my opinion, his thicker lower half means his likely future home is as a shift-aided second baseman at maturity. He's short back to the ball with some pop, his swing is bottom-hand heavy, which leaves him somewhat vulnerable to velo in on his hands, but he's selective enough to swing at pitches he can damage. Despite the patience and bat control, I think he ends up with closer to average contact ability but fully actualized power production, a well-rounded offensive package that cleanly profiles at second base. His average exit velo was 88 mph last year, and there's not a lot of room on the body, so that might be all.","613T5IEJ7rk","sa3004615"
"Triston Casas","BOS","1B","A+",60,2,,"50",2023,,"20.4972222","6' 4""","238","L","R",2018,"Draft","BOS",2552800,"American Heritage HS (FL)","Casas was one of the more heavily scouted underclassman high school prospects in recent memory, and stood out while hitting in the heart of the lineup for South Florida-powerhouse American Heritage, various Team USA squads, and at travel showcases and tournaments. Some of that success was probably because he was one of the oldest prospects in the 2019 graduating class, which prompted him to accelerate his schooling in 2017 and reclassify for the 2018 draft. Moving up a year made him age-appropriate for a high schooler in their draft year; at 18.4, he was basically average for a prep player. With that early-career acclaim came a change in the way opposing pitchers approached Casas. They began to pitch around him, and scouts often left his games having seen him swing just once or twice because he walked constantly. Luckily Casas had a long track record of hitting in games, had participated in multiple home run derbies during his amateur summers, and posted gaudy exit velocities during team pre-draft workouts, so clubs knew what his offensive potential was. 
He has good hands and a plus arm that helped him pitch into the low-90's on the mound, but is a well-below average runner with poor lateral mobility. He played third base after signing, though mostly during instructs, as Casas injured his thumb sliding for a ground ball in June, needed surgery, and barely played during the summer. But expectations are that he'll move across the diamond to first base in 2019 or 2020, where we think he'll be quite good. Casas' calling card is his bat and there's potential for a 60 hit, 70 game power, 80 raw power kind of package. The margin for error for teenage, first base-only types is very small, but we're also very high on Casas' bat.","900T_ozI7iY","sa3007634"
"Bryan Mata","BOS","RHP",,,3,,"45+",2021,,"21.1972222","6' 3""","175","R","R",2015,"J2","BOS",25000,"Venezuela","It's fairly important to view Mata's performance through an age-appropriate lens. The Red Sox hit the accelerator on his development early (a common occurrence in this system) and sent Mata right to full season ball in 2017 when he was just 18-years old. That gives context to Mata's 2018 struggles; he couldn't throw strikes (he had a 17% walk rate), his stuff was up and down throughout the year, and he dealt with a back injury. Several of those things improved in 2019. More purposeful deployment of a robust, four-pitch mix dropped Mata's walk rate to an acceptable 9%, and his stuff was more consistent even though he missed a month with a shoulder strain. And that stuff? A sinker up to 99 (it won't miss bats, but it's tough to square up), a two-plane breaking ball that he'll throw for strike one or as a putaway pitch, a changeup with movement that mirrors the sinker, and a cutter/slider that Mata is still in the early stages of harnessing. 
Because the fastball is more of a sinker, secondary execution and command will be necessary for him to miss as many bats as possible, and there are forces opposing one another when it comes to projecting his command. On the one hand, he's only 20 and has huge stuff. On the other, he's at best a fringe athlete, and has a relieverish delivery. This could break in a number of different ways, but unless Mata keeps getting hurt or his control totally unravels like it did two seasons ago, he's going to be a core part of a big league staff. For now, we expect that to be in a 120ish inning capacity.","_xTejFK8I5g","sa917784"

Here is the list of qualified 2019 big league hitters with the highest strikeout rates in the majors (all between 27% and 32%), along with their strikeout rates at Double-A: Rougie Odor (16%), Domingo Santana (29%), Ryan McMahon (27%), Eugenio Suarez (20%), Franmil Reyes (23%), Luke Voit (15%), Javy Baez (28%), Yoan Moncada (30%), Jackie Bradley (18%), Khris Davis (19%). Most of these players saw a dramatic increase in strikeouts once they got to the big leagues. Those with sky-high Double-A strikeout rates who have gone on to become star big leaguers are all physical freaks, super-human talents; you can include Miguel Sano and Joey Gallo, who were hurt in 2019 and did not qualify for the list, among them.
Dalbec, whose struggles with whiffs date back to his days in college, struck out 28% of the time at Double-A. That is a strong indication he will probably strike out a ton, probably too much to be an everyday player. But he does have thunderous, all-fields power and he's athletic enough to handle third base despite his considerable size. He's also shown improved patience at the plate. We think all of this will combine to create a viable role player or low-end regular at third base, but we acknowledge there's risk that the hit tool bottoms out.","ZDPCbTYDtRo","sa857701"

He was clearly a first round talent ahead of last year's draft, but it was unclear where he'd be picked because of his military commitment. Currently, service academy policy states Song must complete two years of Naval service. The Trump administration repealed an Obama-era rule that allowed athletes to petition for an exemption in order to pursue pro sports or some other activity that might bolster recruitment or the image of the military in general. Whether this rule is reinstated via executive action will have a significant impact on Song's future. He'll either enter pro ball full-time soon, and perhaps move quickly thanks to the quality of his stuff, or he'll be away from baseball for two years and return when he's nearly 25. 
Song works fast and throws hard. He was up to 99 during Team USA's Premier12 scrimmages in Arizona, his slider is plus, and he will mix in the occasional knee-buckling rainbow curveball. He at least profiles in a high-leverage relief role given the current composition of his stuff and control, and perhaps more than that if he's put into the development pipeline quickly. If not, we can't anticipate what'll happen to his stuff because of the layoff. It's tough to wrangle just how that impacts Song's standing as a prospect even if it doesn't impact his talent as currently constituted.","8izj28iTiyo","sa3011695"

He is a true 80 runner and has a running back build at a physical 5-foot-11, but has little power to his game due to a very simple, opposite-field, slap-oriented approach, especially from the left side. While both swings are concerning for several reasons (bat path, balance, varied lower half use), there is unmistakable feel for contact and impressive hand-eye coordination. Due to the approach and swing, Jimenez's exit velos are low enough to be in a sort of danger zone, and he's not physically projectable. Any hope for impact contact has to come from projection on the swing itself, and Jimenez shows more pop in BP and he hasn't been switch-hitting for very long, so it's possible. 
We don't want to overthink this one, and even though the swing needs polish, this is a plus-plus athlete with what the org thinks is plus-plus makeup, elite speed, and impact defense and arm strength. On top of all this, Jimenez led the college-heavy New York-Penn League in hitting as a 19 year-old primarily hitting left-handed, something he started doing just two years ago in instructional league. He's also the type of player who we don't mind projecting on a bit as a premium athlete with premium makeup and adjustability, since he's more likely to handle failure and change in pro ball better than most.",,"sa3005507"
"Matthew Lugo","BOS","SS","A-",,7,,"40+",2024,,"19.1805555","6' 1""","185","R","R",2019,"Draft","BOS",1100000,"Beltran Academy HS (PR)","Teams were divided on Lugo before the draft, perhaps because he had a slow start to his spring and was a little tougher to see than the typical prospect in the Southeast -- scouts had to fly to Puerto Rico the day before and could only get in one game a day while they were there, whereas they could easily have seen five to six quality games if they hung around major metro areas for the same period. As such, if higher ups got a bad look at Lugo early, they likely didn't go back in. That seems to be what happened here, and explains why Lugo fell past where we anticipated given his skillset and physical projection. 
Lugo isn't especially toolsy, but we think he's likely to stick at short and develop something close to average offensive tools, which gives him a shot to be an everyday player.","a4yMWyebTt8","sa1169598"
"Cameron Cannon","BOS","3B","A-",,8,,"40",2023,,"22.7444444","5' 10""","196","R","R",2019,"Draft","BOS",1300000,"Arizona","Cannon's amateur stock was founded on two years of elite statistical performance, including a .390/.480/.640 line as a junior and more walks than strikeouts during the course of his career. He has a surprising amount of power, both for a hitter who played half his games at cavernous Hi Corbett Field in Tucson, and one who has such a conservative-looking swing that lacks explosive involvement of the lower half. 
Cannon can't play shortstop, but has a shot to play second or third (some scouts have him in left field). A move will make it more important for the power to play in pro ball, which may require a relatively simple swing change. That didn't happen immediately after Cannon signed, but it doesn't have to unless poor performance makes it necessary.","4YQQgwjQsjI","sa3011467"
"Tanner Houck","BOS","RHP","AAA",,9,,"40",2020,,"24.0416666","6' 5""","220","R","R",2017,"Draft","BOS",2614500,"Missouri","Houck became famous pretty early in his college career because he was the ace of Team USA as an underclassman, slinging in a sinkering 96 and a plus slider. Scouts who weren't as enthusiastic about his changeup, or arm slot, or the length of his arm action, or the way his stuff would flatten out and his command would back up later in starts thought he was surely a reliever. The Red Sox had Houck change his delivery and arm action for the first half-dozen or so starts in 2018, focusing on a more traditional four-seam fastball approach. It didn't work, and Boston let him go back to what he had been doing later in the year; his dominant final two months of 2018 reflect his comfort with this approach. 
We think Houck's likely outcome is as a multi-inning power reliever who dominates righties with strikeouts and groundballs, though some see a starter in the mold of Justin Masterson. He can sink it, cut it, his slider is death to righties, and he'll bully lefties with the fastball enough to get by, just not if they get multiple looks at him.","QTDQgUJS9H4","sa829037"
"Jarren Duran","BOS","CF",,,10,,"40",2022,,"23.8583333","6' 2""","200","L","R",2018,"Draft","BOS",189800,"Long Beach State","The trajectory of Duran's rise is unique. During collegiate scrimmages in the fall of 2017, scouts saw a big, athletic second baseman who was just okay defensively, had an all-fields line drive approach without much pop, and plus to plus-plus speed. Duran had a fine junior spring, but hit for almost no power (which perhaps should be expected in a pitcher-friendly home park like Blair Field in Long Beach), and slipped to the seventh round as a nearly-22-year-old with a modest statistical track record. 
After signing, the Red Sox had Duran change his swing a bit in BP to see if they could tap into something more, and he started raking at Low-A. Duran had 13 extra base hits in 253 PA in 2018 for Long Beach State; across two pro levels, he had 28 extra base hits in 302 PA, including 11 triples. Once we got a look at Duran up against elite peers at the Futures Game, and for an extended stretch of the Fall League, it became clear he has poor outfield instincts and likely won't have the in-game pop he showed early in the year. He can fly and he has relevant contact skills, but no clear position and not enough power to overcome that. His outfield defense has to improve, and even then he's likely a fourth outfielder or low-end regular.","L8gFdZbJcrc","sa3006786"

Bello spent 2018 as a 19-year-old in the DSL, then was skipped over two levels and sent right to full-season ball last year. He ended up throwing nearly twice as many innings as he had the year before, but rather than show fatigue toward the end of the season, Bello actually had his better starts during the second half of the summer. During those he's bump 98, miss both right- and left-handed bats with his changeup, and flash an occasionally nasty slider. 
The movement profile on Bello's fastball is mediocre, but he's a loose, semi-projectable 20-year-old so more velo might be coming to offset the lack of action. Realistically, this is a backend starter, but there's more variance because of the chance of a velo uptick.",,"sa3005436"

He signed as a 20-year-old out of college in Taiwan; most top Taiwanese talents sign at age 18 out of high school. The Red Sox were on Liu at that age as an infielder, but he took a step forward as a reliever recently, hitting anywhere from 98 to 101 mph depending on whose radar gun you were looking at. 
Liu is small but very athletic. His slider is above average to plus pretty consistently, while his splitter flashes similarly. He also mixed in a curveball as a fourth pitch. Already 20, and with almost zero track record on the mound other than a handful of innings, Liu is obviously risky but might also just be scratching the surface of something. Boston felt better about his makeup than many teams could have due to their history with him as an infielder, and because they had first-hand locker room dope from Premier12 teammate, and Red Sox infielder, Tzu-Wei Lin. Liu will likely see action in extended spring training and Low-A in 2020.","3woHZ4NFjXw",

A wrist injury meant he sat for most of his first pro summer when he would have first been able to get his feet wet against pro pitching, and the leap to the Penn League the next summer proved to be too much; he struck out 30% of the time for Lowell. We're still on the power, lift in the swing, size, speed underway, and physicality, but Decker needs to hit because he's a corner-only guy, and he hasn't done that yet.","JfxRX_cb-VE","sa3008590"

He was graceful, projectable, and already had average big league stuff almost two years before he was even eligible to be drafted. That stuff just kept improving, peaking the summer before his draft year when Groome would work 92-96 mph in short stints with an easy, plus curveball while folding in an average to above changeup, doing so with a big, athletic frame and starter's delivery, all of which led to him being mentioned as a possible No. 1 overall pick. But a myriad of concerns unrelated to Groome's talent dogged him more than most prep prospects, most of them stemming from an unstable living situation that involved drugs and guns, for which his father was later arrested. That, combined with a quickly thickening frame and issues with his commitment to Vanderbilt, contributed to his fall out of the top 10 picks of the 2016 draft. 
Since signing, Groome hasn't been on the mound much, making just 20 total pro starts due to a back injury and, eventually, Tommy John surgery. He came back from TJ late last August and got four innings of work before instructional league, where he got another eight to 10 frames, working 93-95 two innings at a time. Groome is Rule 5 eligible next winter and he's never thrown more than 55 innings in any of his four pro seasons. Those two things create some pressure and make it likely that the Red Sox either really need to push him next year, creating more risk that he'll get hurt yet again, or that he'll just be bullpen'd to give him a better shot at contributing in 2021. Does he arguably have more upside than all but a handful of others in this org? Sure, but circumstances impacting his development make it highly unlikely he gets there.","2KZQaauTk3Y","sa917925"

That, along with a few defensive flaws that may still be corrected with time, especially as he learns to handle upper-level stuff in the dirt, probably limits Wong to a unique kind of utility role or a backup catcher and infielder role similar to Austin Barnes', which is a bit better than just a flat 40 FV prospect.",,"sa873978"

Bonaci isn't huge at 5-foot-10 but has some raw power from both sides, including surprisingly high in-game exit velos.

He's played a mix of third and first base at big events and I have him projected as a 1B-only, though I think his hands are excellent and that he'll be quite good there. Jordan's present power and feel for contact are really promising for someone his age.

Chacon is a hit-first prospect at this point but there's projection and some present raw power, so he should be able to profile as an everyday type if he continues developing.",,

During that stretch he struck out 61 in 47 innings. Politi is deceptive, his fastball has ride at the top of the zone, and he commands his slider and will flash an occasionally good changeup. It's an interesting package with the arrow pointing up.",,"sa3007243"

He spent his entire first full pro season at Double-A missing bats but also missing locations -- a lot -- and his velocity was down a little bit. The fastball still has bat-missing traits, but unless there's a rebound, Feltman is more likely to be a middle reliever than a late-inning arm.","l9o5I-rLP60","sa3007959"

He was mostly the same at Kansas and went in the third round last summer as a power arm with a standout fastball and above average breaker. His delivery and command are still a work in progress, and one Red Sox source called him a ball of clay, with seventh or eighth inning reliever the most likely outcome.",,"sa3011217"

He had a very successful 13-start stretch in the New York-Penn League -- 61 innings, 63 punch outs, 16 walks -- working off of three pitches. He has a vertical arm slot and hand position that create backspin that will let his fastball play atop the strike zone, though he doesn't work up there as often as he could. His slider is average but has effective, vertical movement, and he has fairly advanced arm-side changeup feel. 
An average athlete with a smaller frame, there's no overt physical projection that allows us to get excited about Ramirez growing into a monster fastball, so instead we think he's a developmental fifth starter.",,"sa3005371"

Still relatively crude as a hitter (and we're always skeptical of physically mature hitters performing in the DSL), Feliz is a leviathan with plus-plus raw power. He'll likely be limited to left field or first base, especially if he somehow gets bigger, which, combined with relatively raw pitch recognition, makes him a prospect of extreme risk. Ordinarily at this stage, this is just a 35 FV guy for us, but this dude's size and power at his age is rare, in the Luken Baker/Josh Naylor area.",,"sa3008799"

He is sleight of build and doesn't throw very hard, so there's not big fastball projection here, but Rodriguez does spin his heater much more than is usual for someone who only throws in the low-90s, so it might be an impact pitch even if he only ends up with average velo. He's a candidate to begin 2020 in full season ball based on how Boston handles polished teenage arms.",,"sa3006074"

At times, he is dominant -- one source spoke of seeing him strike out four of the six hitters he faced in an outing while breaking the bats of the other two -- but he's not consistent enough to be relied on in a big league bullpen right now. The Red Sox put him on the 40-man, so how he develops during the early part of next year is important. The body, athleticism, arm strength (94-97, up to 100), and fledgling feel for spin are exciting.",,"sa829086"

He continued to walk too many at FSU, but his velo popped in the fall due in part to a more aggressive delivery and he looked poised for a big 2020. Last fall he was 92-94 with the same plus hook and an improved changeup along with more strikes, then he struggled with walks in an abbreviated 2020.
