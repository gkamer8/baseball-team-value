His arm action is a little stiff and long, but boy is it fast, and it generates a fastball in the 92-96 mph range (mostly 3s and 4s) with riding life. Gray’s size and the drop-and-drive nature of his delivery combine to create flat pitch approach angle that helps his fastball miss bats at the top of the zone. Thanks to his athleticism, Gray repeats his mechanics, and throws more strikes than is typical for someone who has this kind of nasty stuff but has only been pitching full-time since 2018, and he has an especially notable proclivity for locating his fastball to his arm side. 
The slider can slurve out and even get kind of short and cuttery at times, but when it's well-located and Gray is on top of the ball, it’s a plus pitch. His changeup, which he seldom used in 2019, induced some ugly swings during the Dodgers' pre-season intrasquad games, so it appears that offering has made a leap. Gray has been making constant adjustments to his repertoire for the last couple of years and has not only succeeded but quickly became good enough to compete (in a practice environment) against the lineup that would eventually win the World Series. He projects as a mid-rotation stalwart. <em>(Alternate site)</em>","xYWS5T8z7qQ","sa3007475"

He has much better feel for contact than all but a few players in the minors, let alone the catchers. It has allowed Ruiz to get away with an overly-expansive approach. He swings at far too many pitches outside the zone, but he is so often able to get the barrel there that it hasn't mattered, and he's a .299 career hitter in spite of this. While Ruiz makes remarkably consistent contact, it's not all that hard, and he's unlikely to hit for more than doubles power in the big leagues. But I think even a one-dimensional, contact-only offensive profile like Keibert's is enough to catch everyday, and while I consider him a capable defender, it's worth noting that some clubs do not. 
Ruiz has baby soft hands and is a great pitch-framer and receiver, but he's a casual, low-effort ball-blocker who'd much rather rely on his hands to pick balls in the dirt than be mobile and throw his body in front of the baseball. I think his hands are so good that he'll get away with this, but others think it impacts his pitchers' conviction in throwing breaking balls that finish in the dirt. Arm-wise, Ruiz's slow exchange drags his pop times down, but he's very accurate and I'm starting to think that so long as one has sufficient arm strength, accuracy might matter more than the pop time. But again, this is not a universally-held belief. I've got an everyday grade on Ruiz, but unless the Dodgers want to carry three catchers, I think he is the odd man out and a potential trade centerpiece this offseason. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>","jGl4H285JjI","19610"

It makes sense for the Dodgers to keep working with him at second base, just in case he can get good enough to actually play there some of the time. I did not have an extended look at him in the Fall but the scouts who did think he could eventually be passable there, but definitely not good, much like Tommy La Stella. Busch played the keystone for an extended stretch on the Cape in 2018 but spent his career at North Carolina playing mostly first base and some corner outfield, and those are the two positions pro scouts think he'll move to if second doesn't work out. 
But most importantly, Busch really hits, and is probably an everyday player even if he ends up mostly playing left field. He's patient, tracks pitches well, and has big, strength-driven power. I consider Busch a high-probability big leaguer who could have some years of star-level WAR output if he can play second semi-regularly. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>","2A597xbLtFA","sa3011540"

As you would probably expect from a hitter with such a steep swing (this is about as steep as one can get without it becoming a problem), Pages swings and misses quite a bit and instead has a power-driven profile. He can hit balls out with a flick of the wrist, even when he hasn't taken his best swing. His speed under way and defensive instincts give him a chance to stay in center field, which would obviously give Pages a little more margin for error as a hitter. If he stays in center, he has a star-level ceiling. If not, then he has a whiff-prone, traditional right field profile driven by obvious impact power. Even if the latter occurs, it's very likely Pages not only gets to all of his raw power, but might outperform it because of how often he's able to lift the baseball. He's a launch angle unicorn with the thump to take advantage of it and a non-zero chance of staying at a premium defensive spot, though I don't think it's likely. He'll be toward the back of this offseason's overall top 100 list. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3005625"

Though not especially rangy at shortstop, he has plus hands and actions, and enough arm strength to stay on the left side of the infield. Amaya comes off as a utility guy during a quick glance because of a lack of BP power and physical projection, but he has a great eye for the strike zone, as well as an idea of which pitches he can drive. He's got a short, punchy swing you can't just beat with velo. He'll hit a bunch of doubles.

Pepiot is one of the pitchers in this mold, and while it can take him a few tries to get feel for his changeup's release, once he does it is a lethal offering. He can mis-locate it and still get a swing and miss, or freeze left-handed hitters who think the pitch is inside when in fact it tails back over the plate. This is Pepiot's style generally, relying on stuff much more than precision. Now that he's had a velocity spike (sitting 93-96, up from 90-94 throughout an up-and-down 2019), that type of approach is more viable. Remember that Pepiot's stuff took a nose dive during his 2019 draft year and the 2020 developmental environment was weird, so we don't know if he'll hold that velo all season as a starter.

He came out of the gate as a Red Raiders starter in 2020 and was not only electric, sitting in the mid-90s with two plus or better breaking balls, but also threw strikes. It was at this point that his draft stock exploded in a very short amount of time. His fastball has big carry thanks to its backspinning axis, and it works similar to the way Rays righty Nick Anderson's does, as do his breaking balls. This is ready-made elite bullpen stuff, but because of the shortened season, Beeter only has a four-start track record of viable strike-throwing. <em>(Pre-draft, alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3014536"

His junior season was cut short because of the pandemic but he was still widely seen, even in 2020, because he pitched in a prospect-heavy Week 1 matchup versus Ole Miss and then in an early-March duel with Wake Forest (and fellow first rounder Jared Shuster) that was attended by a huge contingent of scouting directors and crosscheckers. Miller shoved, especially in that last game against Wake Forest. He has a long, atypical arm action but he throws a starter-worthy ratio of strikes and holds his velo deep into games, reaching back for 95-97 when he needs it. That pitch has nasty, bowling ball sink. In addition to the velocity, Miller has a plus, mid-80s slider and a developing power changeup. Not all teams were comfortable with his delivery but it's not all that dissimilar from that of 2019 first rounder Ryan Jensen, and Miller has better secondary stuff, so I thought it was clear he belonged in the middle of the first round. He was still throwing hard in the Fall. I think Miller has a better chance to start than Beeter. <em>(Pre-draft, alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3014422"

Hoese was the 2019 case. After putting up an .803 OPS in his draft-eligible sophomore year (he went in the 35th round and didn't sign), he put up a 1.276 OPS in his junior year, with 23 homers and a 38:30 BB/K ratio. He was handled with care by the Dodgers after he signed, spending a lot of time in the AZL and DH'ing due to wrist and forearm tendinitis. He dealt with more wrist trouble during the spring of 2020 and had just been totally cleared and begun to throw to bases a week before the game shutdown due to COVID-19. He picked up additional reps during Fall Instructional League. 
Hoese's exit velo data was way down in pro ball, something I'm dismissing because of the injury and therefore am excluding from The Board until we get a valid sample (his college avg/max was 88/104, pro was 84/100). He's not tooled up and doesn't have huge raw power, even with a healthy wrist. Instead he's a very athletic swinger with a quick bat, whose swing is geared for airborne contact. That should help him get to power in games even though there's not huge raw. Hoese will need to attain a balanced hit/power combination to profile at third base, but the Dodgers have had internal conversations about trying him in the middle infield (they tried him there a bit during the Fall), which is obviously an easier bar to clear. His already odd, slow developmental track was further warped and flagged by the pandemic, and the soon-to-be 24-year-old has yet to see an at-bat above Low-A. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3010021"

But his run-stopping arm strength and accuracy, as well as his prodigious field general presence, mean he's likely to have a defensive impact. Cartaya is not afraid to backpick runners, which is rare for a catcher this age, especially when the infielders are typically not reliable recipients of such lasers. For such a large catcher, his exchange is very quick and remarkably consistent. He's out of his crouch fast and in one fell swoop, unfurls, releases, and then folds forward, bent at the waist, as the ball sizzles on a line to the base. 
Cartaya is also a balanced, explosive hitter with feel for hitting the ball in the air. He expands the zone a bit too much right now, but he has the physical ability to hit and hit for power, which is rare for catchers and catching prospects. The rate of failure for teenage catchers is high but Cartaya has an All-Star ceiling. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>","c-LTwTIlv7s","sa3008742"

He became more agile and twitchy between when he signed and his pro debut in the DSL, and it was quickly evident that he was too advanced for that league, so the Dodgers pushed him Stateside, where his swing decisions were poor. Though he's especially adept at impacting balls toward the bottom of the zone, De Jesus has shown other hitter-ish traits early on. He adjusts his posture to alter his bat path depending on pitch location, and I've seen him make in-flight adjustments to breaking balls and wait for them effectively, all at age 17 against older pros in the AZL. 
But he does swing too often and that part needs to get better.The physical tools and body projection (DeJesus body comps to Manny Machado) are exciting, though. DeJesus has seen early-career time at shortstop, when on the day he signed it seemed like a foregone conclusion that he'd only play third base. He may end up back at the hot corner eventually but has a fair chance to stay up the middle. If he does, and he grows into all the raw power I think he will, he could be a star. If he kicks to third base, then hopefully the swing and miss rates from the 2019 season are just a result of him being 17 rather than a sign of things to come. <em>(Dominican Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3008842"

Athletically, Vargas is on the 3B/1B fringe. It's pretty rare for a player with this type of defensive fit to become a great everyday hitter without generating more power, but the game has a promising, prominent, and recent example in Phillies third baseman Alec Bohm. Because of his frame, Bohm (who was a 50 FV prospect) has better long-term power projection than Vargas (and more present power), but that's what the latter's path to an everyday role looks like.

Last year, I rounded his FV down a tad due to his age, though you could argue there are fewer miles on Jackson's arm and that his relative inexperience means he actually has a better chance of holding his stuff into his 30s than that adjustment assumes.

Aside from some pre-draft bullpens, he didn't pitch as a junior, and spent the rest of the year finishing rehab and working on secondary stuff in the 'pen. 
In 2019, his first year back, the Dodgers sent him straight to Hi-A to work in abbreviated starts over the course of a whole season rather than pitch five-plus innings every start and be shut down mid-year. He was 90-93, touching 95 with the fastball and working with two different breaking balls, a low-80s curveball and an upper-80s slider. It's not big velocity, but Grove creates weird angle on his fastball, which has near perfect backspin as well as carry at the top of the zone. Grove spent 2020 at the alternate site at UCLA. He's now 24 and because of the timing of his injury, he's never had to stand up to the rigors of a starter's workload, either in amateur or pro ball.

His hellacious sinking and tailing fastball has movement that mimics his changeup (which did look better during intrasquads), while he also bullies hitters with a firm slider and a power curveball, which looks good but is easy to identify out of his hand.
