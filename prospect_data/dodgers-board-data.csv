"Gavin Lux","LAD","2B",,2,1,,"70",2020,,"22.6416666","6' 2""","190","L","R",2016,"Draft","LAD",2317000,"Indian Trail Academy HS (WI)","A highly entertaining example of the timeless ""you can't predict baseball"" maxim, in three years Lux has tranformed from a glove-first high school shortstop (there's a version of reality in which Lux, Bo Bichette, Hunter Bishop, <em>and</em> Spencer Torkelson are all on the same college team, though sadly, it's not this one) into a superstar offensive talent. If you want a visual example of ""twitch,"" watch Lux swing. His feet work slowly, and his right knee draws back toward his left hip like the string of a bow (different than his high school swing's footwork, which was more Sammy Sosa-ish, with ground contact in both directions) while he remains balanced and poised to strike. Then he strides forward, his hips clear, and his hands, which are looser and freer than they were as an amateur, ignite. Once Lux's hands get going, everything is over very quickly. He's tough to beat with even premium velocity but also identifies pitch types while they're in flight and can punish secondary stuff that catches too much of the zone. The other swing changes aside, Lux's bat path is relatively similar to what it was when he was a skinnier, gap-to-gap hitter with doubles power, except now he's very strong and balls are leaving the yard. He has pole-to-pole power and is going to get to it in games even though he's still a relatively low-launch angle hitter (nine degrees in the minors, 13 degrees in a small big league sample). 
What happens with Lux defensively is somewhat immaterial. He's publicly admitted to having the yips, which impacts the accuracy of his throws. Pure arm strength is not really an issue, but if he keeps one-hopping easy throws to first base, he might need to move off the infield. I have the arm graded as a 45 because of the accuracy issues and think there's some risk Lux needs to move to the outfield, but even if that's the case, I feel better about him hitting than all but one other prospect in all of the minors.","UN_FiRAXe4Q","19955"
"Dustin May","LAD","RHP","MLB",14,2,,"60",2020,,"22.8555555","6' 6""","180","R","R",2016,"Draft","LAD",1000000,"Northwest HS (TX)","Once you've gotten a look at his stuff, May's flamboyant ginger curls and Bronson Arroyo-esque leg kick might be the third and fourth most visually captivating aspects of his on-mound presence. His fastballs, both the two and four-seam variants, are parked in the 93-97 range and peak at 99 mph. His low-ish arm slot gives his heater sinker shape, which means it's more likely to induce weak groundballs than it is to miss a lot of bats, though May occasionally uncorks two-seamers that run off the hips of left-handed hitters and back into the zone like vintage Bartolo Colon. Based on how he worked in the big leagues last year, May's out-pitch is going to be his low-90s cutter, which he commands to his glove side (he has great east/west command of everything). This is despite the fact that his vertically-breaking slider (May calls it a slider, but it has curveball shape) has one of the better spin rates in the minors and enough vertical depth to miss bats against both left and right-handed hitters. He's shown an ability to backdoor it to lefties and it was a finishing pitch for him in some of my minor league viewings, but it was de-emphasized in the big leagues, perhaps because it doesn't pair well with his fastballs. After trying several different changeup grips in 2017, it seems like May is still searching for a good cambio, but his fastball and breaking ball command should suffice against lefties for now, though I'd like to see more backfoot breaking balls against them this year. 
This is nit-picky, but May's leg kick can make him slow to home and he can be vulnerable to stolen bases as a result, which forces him to vary his cadence home in an attempt to stymie runners. Regardless, he projects as an All-Star, mid-rotation starter.","xvHfqB6Fl5w","19716"
"Josiah Gray","LAD","RHP",,70,3,,"50",2022,,"22.5638888","6' 1""","210","R","R",2018,"Draft","CIN",772500,"LeMoyne","Gray is an athletic, undersized conversion arm with big time arm-acceleration. His arm action is a little stiff, but it’s fast, and generates a fastball in the 92-96 mph range (mostly 3s and 4s) with riding life. Gray’s size and the drop and drive nature of his delivery combine to create flat plane that plays well up in the zone. He’ll miss bats at the letters with his heater. Thanks to his athleticism, Gray repeats, and throws more strikes than is typical for someone fairly new to pitching who has this kind of stuff, with a notable proclivity for locating his fastball to his arm side. 
The slider can slurve out and even get kind of short and cuttery at times, but when it's well-located and Gray is on top of the ball, it’s a plus pitch. His changeup, which he seldom uses at the moment, is easy to identify out of the hand due to arm deceleration, and is comfortably below average. 
Because the strike throwing, fastball efficacy, and ability to spin the breaking ball give him a good shot to play a big league role, I've moved Gray up beyond where Kiley and I had him pre-draft. The athleticism, small school pedigree, and position player conversion aspect of the profile indicates there’s significant potential for growth as Gray gets on-mound experience. He projects as a No. 4 starter, with a chance to be more because of his late-bloomer qualities.",,"sa3007475"
"Tony Gonsolin","LAD","RHP",,88,4,,"50",2020,,"26.1666666","6' 2""","180","R","R",2016,"Draft","LAD",2500,"St. Mary's","A two-way college player, Gonsolin was a ninth round senior sign whose velocity spiked in pro ball when he focused on pitching, moved to the bullpen (he has since moved back into the rotation, after he was yo-yo'd back and forth in college), and was touched by the Dodgers' excellent player dev group. At times his fastball has been in the upper-90s, cresting 100, but last year he was 91-96 from a very deceptive vertical slot. 
Gonsolin's four-pitch mix looks like it was designed in a lab and considering the way his stuff works together, it may have been. He's an extreme overhand, backspinning four-seam guy, and he works up at the letters with it. It's complemented by a deep-diving, 12-6 curveball. He'll also work an upper-80s slider to his glove side and it has shocking, horizontal length considering Gonsonlin's arm slot. But the headline offering here is the changeup, a split-action cambio that bottoms out as it reaches the plate. Gonsolin uses it against both left- and right-handed hitters and it's one of the best changeups in the minors. It's a non-traditional style of pitching for a starter, so some eyeball scouts think he ends up in the bullpen. If so, it's probably in a valuable multi-inning role.","5Up3xEVGF-I","19388"

Ruiz is a skills-over-tools catcher, an acquired taste some scouts like and others don't. The hand-eye coordination and bat-to-ball skills are very strong, but the contact quality is not. Reviews of his defense -- in my looks he's been a good receiver, the game appears slow and comfortable for him, and all of his throws have been right on the bag -- have become more mixed over the last year. Catchers with any sort of offensive ability, especially high-end contact skills, are rare, but athletic longevity may be an issue because of Ruiz's build.","jGl4H285JjI","sa872528"
"Brusdar Graterol","LAD","RHP","MLB",120,6,,"50",2020,,"21.8833333","6' 1""","265","R","R",2014,"J2","MIN",150000,"Venezuela","Graterol signed for $150,000 in 2014 out of Venezuela and had Tommy John surgery within a year. He popped up on the radar a few seasons later when he was throwing upper-90s gas in Fort Myers during instructs, and only began making noise in full-season ball in 2018 when he pitched well as a teenager at Hi-A. 
At that time, it appeared Brusdar had a frontline starter future. He was sitting 96-99, touching 100, his slider was already very good, and he had started to develop changeup feel. Graterol thickened considerably during this stretch and is now listed at 265 pounds after he signed at 170. This, combined with some release point variance and injury hiccups (three IL stints in the last year and a half, including some shoulder stuff), have led to relief risk in the eyes of some clubs. Indeed the Twins put Brusdar in the bullpen late in the year and had publicly declared their intent to put him there again this season before they traded him to the Dodgers (after initially sending him to the Red Sox) as part of the Mookie Betts musical chairs deal. 
He de-emphasized the changeup during his 2019 relief stretch, but of course he may be subject to more tweaks with his new org. I think the slider command gives him a puncher's chance to start even with a limited repertoire, but I think he winds up in high-leverage relief.","5VxhHnSA2hg","20367"

Cartaya is not afraid to backpick runners, which is rare for a catcher this age, especially when the infielders are typically not reliable recipients of such lasers. For such a large catcher, his exchange is very quick and remarkably consistent. He's out of his crouch fast and, in one fell swoop, unfurls, releases, and then folds forward, bent at the waist, as the ball sizzles on a line to the base. 
Cartaya is also a balanced, explosive hitter with feel for hitting the ball in the air. He expands the zone a bit too much right now, but he has the physical ability to hit and hit for power, which is rare for catchers and catching prospects. The rate of failure for teenage catchers is high but Cartaya has an All-Star ceiling.","c-LTwTIlv7s","sa3008742"
"Andy Pages","LAD","CF","R",,8,,"45+",2023,,"19.6","6' 1""","195","R","R",2017,"J2","LAD",,"Dominican Republic","There was support for Pages' inclusion on my overall top 100 list, and he was to be part of the Joc Pederson/Ross Stripling deal with the Angels until, as Arte Moreno has stated publicly, the Angels owner nixed the deal. While his statline was definitely caricatured by the hitting environment in the Pioneer League, Pages does indeed have substantial power and based on his feel to hit the ball in the air, he's likely to get to it in games. Pages' average launch angle in 2019 was a whopping 25 degrees, which would be the highest among major league players (Rhys Hoskins' averaged an angle of 24 degrees last year) and was in the top five across all of pro baseball last year. 
As you would probably expect for a hitter with such a steep swing, Pages strikes out quite a bit. His speed and defensive instincts give him a chance to stay in center field, though, which gives Pages a little more margin for error as a hitter. If he stays in center, he has a star-level ceiling. If not, then he has a whiff-prone, traditional right field profile. Even if the latter occurs, it's very likely Pages not only gets to all of his raw power but that he might outhit it because of how often he's able to lift the baseball. He's a launch angle unicorn with the power to take advantage of it and a non-zero chance of staying at a premium defensive spot (though I don't think it's likely).",,"sa3005625"
"Kody Hoese","LAD","3B",,,9,,"45",2022,,"23.0027777","6' 4""","200","R","R",2019,"Draft","LAD",,"Tulane","Every year, a college player who was draft-eligible the year before takes a sudden leap, performs at an elite level, and forces teams to consider whether there's been a real uptick in his skill or if the player is just beating up on competition, in essence repeating a level. Hoese was the 2019 case. After putting up an .803 OPS in his draft-eligible sophomore year (he went in the 35th round and didn't sign), he put up a 1.276 OPS in his junior year, with 23 homers and a 38:30 BB/K ratio. He was handled with care by the Dodgers after he signed, spending a lot of time in the AZL and DH'ing due to wrist and forearm tendinitis. He dealt with more wrist trouble this spring and had just been totally cleared and begun throwing to bases a week before the shutdown. 
Hoese's exit velo data was way down in pro ball, something I'm dismissing because of the injury and therefore excluding from The Board (his college avg/max was 88/104, pro was 84/100). He's not tooled up and doesn't have huge raw power or bat speed, even with a healthy wrist. Instead he's a very athletic swinger whose swing is geared for airborne contact. That should help him get to power in games even though there's not huge raw. Hoese'll need to get to all of it to profile at third base, but the Dodgers have had internal conversations about trying him at shortstop, which is obviously an easier bar to clear.",,"sa3010021"
"Michael Busch","LAD","2B",,,10,,"45",2021,,"22.6805555","6' 0""","207","L","R",2019,"Draft","LAD",,"North Carolina","The Dodgers plan to continue experimenting with Busch as a second baseman. He played the keystone for an extended stretch on the Cape in 2018 but spent his career at North Carolina playing mostly first base and some corner outfield. The Dodgers announced him as a second baseman -- other teams considered doing the same thing, and it makes sense that the teams that think he can do it were also the ones who liked Busch most -- and that's all he played for 10 games during the summer before his hand was hit by a pitch, ending his season. He played mostly first in his brief Fall League jaunt and looked bad there, but it was after he had not seen in-game reps for a couple of months, and I think that context is important. 
Los Angeles' plan is to start Busch at second base most the time, but even if he proves passable there with time, he probably won't play there exclusively as a big leaguer. He's more likely to be a bat the Dodgers move around depending on matchups the way they do with Max Muncy. And if Busch can't play second he may just hit enough to profile in an outfield corner or first base, as he's patient, tracks pitches well, and has big, strength-driven power.",,"sa3011540"
"Miguel Vargas","LAD","3B","A+",,11,,"45",2022,,"20.6583333","6' 3""","200","R","R",2017,"J2","LAD",,"Cuba","On last year's Dodgers list, I wrote the following: ""So conservative was Vargas' swing when he first arrived in the States that Dodgers coaches were trying to make adjustments to his lower-half use in the middle of games in the hopes that it would unlock power that was clearly dormant in his hands. He has good control of the strike zone and feel to hit for a teenager but despite playing some second and third, he may ultimately wind up at first base. If that's the case, a change that enables the power is necessary."" In an unsurprising development, the Dodgers did just that. 
Vargas has added a bit of a leg kick and begun hitting the ball in the air a little more often, with his average launch angle moving from 10 degrees to 14. After two and a half months of strong offensive performance at Low-A Great Lakes (where Vargas struggled during a cup of coffee the prior year), he was promoted to Rancho and kept raking. He has terrific hand-eye coordination and bat control, still deriving most of his in-game power from quality of contact rather than big pull and lift. He gets an occasional start at second base but projects to (maybe) play third, and a lot of first. From a raw and game power projection standpoint, I'm not ready to lump Vargas in with the 50 FV first base types at the back of my overall Top 100, but if the hit tool keeps distinguishing itself at Double-A, I will be forced to consider it.",,"sa3006896"

Though not especially rangy at shortstop, Amaya has plus hands and actions and enough arm strength to stay on the left side of the infield. On the surface, a lack of power and physical projection makes him appear like he'll max out as a utility guy, but he makes up some offensive ground because his eye for the strike zone is so good. Instinctive and fundamentally sound, even if Amaya is only a utility type, his chances of getting there are high, and if his secondary skills hold water into the upper levels of the minors perhaps he'll be more than that.",,"sa3005081"

He came out as a starter in 2020 and was electric, sitting in the mid-90s with two plus, or better, breaking balls. His fastball has big carry thanks to its backspinning axis, and it works similar to the way Nick Anderson's does, as do his breaking balls. He's a candidate for immediate placement on a taxi squad during the 2020 season and could pitch out of a big league bullpen this year if he throws strikes in whatever developmental environment MLB puts in place. Beeter walked a batter per inning in 2019 but threw strikes this spring, albeit across just four starts.",,

He moved into Louisville's rotation part way through his sophomore year, so his track record of starting is fairly short. In addition to the velocity, Miller has a plus, mid-80s slider and a developing power change.

He became more agile and twitchy between when he signed and when he made his pro debut in the DSL. It was quickly evident that DeJesus was too advanced for the DSL and the Dodgers pushed him Stateside, where his swing decisions were poor. The physical tools and body projection (DeJesus body comps to Manny Machado) are exciting, though. DeJesus has seen early-career time at shortstop, when on the day he signed, it seemed like a foregone conclusion that he'd only play third base. He may end up back at the hot corner eventually but has a fair chance to stay up the middle. If he does, and he grows into all the raw power I think he will, he could be a star. If he kicks to third base, then hopefully the swing and miss rates from the 2019 are only a result of him being 17 rather than a sign of things to come.",,"sa3008842"

In his first year back, the Dodgers sent him straight to Hi-A to work in abbreviated starts over the course of a whole season rather than pitch five-plus innings every start and be shut down mid-year. He was 90-93, touching 95 with the fastball and working with two different breaking balls, a low-80s curveball and an upper-80s slider. It's not big velocity, but Grove creates weird angle on his fastball and it has near perfect backspin and carry at the top of the zone.

He projects as a No. 4/5 starter but I've rounded his FV down a tad due to his age, though you could argue there are fewer miles on Jackson's arm and that his relative inexperience means he actually has a better chance of holding his stuff into his 30s than that adjustment assumes.",,"sa829605"

At a small-framed 5-foot-10, it's not likely to be much thump. Vivas may be a second base-only defender, which means his only path to a role would be to hit enough to play every day, but early indications are that he may do just that if he grows into more power than I have projected based on his size.",,"sa3005511"

There's little to no recent precedent for a third baseman who is this aggressive having sustained success as a regular unless they have elite bat-to-ball skills, and while Santana has big time bat speed, he's not a contact savant. He has shown some ability to make mechanical adjustments, though, much to the chagrin of those entertained by his former cut, which looked like a Vaudeville comedian miming a baseball swing. So hapless is Santana's current approach that some scouts want to see him put on the mound.

He reshaped his body and transferred from Pierce College in Los Angeles to UC-Irvine, where he had one very strong year prior to signing with the Dodgers. Though he had a limited statistical track record, Lewis was one of the younger draft-eligible college players in his class, which, combined with his relative inexperience (not only did Lewis not have much high-level experience, he also played two-ways for a while), lets you project more on skill growth than is typical for most college prospects.

He was the Dodgers' 10th round senior sign in 2017 and was quickly assigned to Hi-A Rancho Cucamonga, the first of three consecutive, mettle-testing years to which Reks has responded. He hit 28 homers split between Double- and Triple-A in 2019, an uptick in power production that coincided with a multi-year shift in his batted-ball profile, throughout which Reks has more often hit the ball in the air. He really can't play defense, but I think he has some current trade value as a lefty reserve bat.
