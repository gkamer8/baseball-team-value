He hit .259/.394/.444 in the spring off of admittedly diluted pitching, then grinded out long, tough at-bats during the summer tune-up against a staff that would turn out to be quite good. He's also one of the more decorated college hitters ever, slashing .374/.495/.688 at Cal. 
He's very likely to clear the high offensive bar at first base. He's not a great feet-and-hands athlete on the infield but Vaughn's swing is pretty athletic, and sweet. He doesn't chase and seems to have a narrow early-count approach focused on pitches he can crush. He's less able to damage well-executed breaking stuff away from him, but he often spoils those pitches or puts them in play and, again, typically doesn't offer at them until he has to. There's a clearer path to the big leagues for Vaughn now that Edwin Encarnacion and Nomar Mazara are no longer on the roster (I talk more about this in the System Overview), and he'll likely play in the big leagues in 2021. He continues to project as an All-Star first baseman. <em>(Alternate site)</em>","cPv9SsBcKQk","26197"

Pleasant HS (TX)","It sometimes feels foolish to ""wait for things to click"" with very talented but frustrating (and perhaps flawed) prospects, but that's what it seemed like was actually happening for Kopech just before he blew out his elbow late in 2018. The surgery's timing meant Kopech lost all of the 2019 regular season and began rehabbing in a game environment during Fall Instructional League. His first bolt was 99 mph. He settled in at 96-99, and threw several plus sliders. Kopech made his spring 2020 debut on March 10 and threw 11 pitches, six of which were 100 mph or more. It was his only inning of 2020, as Spring Training was shut down soon after, and Kopech would later opt out of the season amid the pandemic and other meaningful off-field considerations. As such, his evaluation is the same.
Kopech's trademark heat and slider give him late-inning potential even if he can't start, an outcome that seems more likely during the early part of his big league career now that he's missed two seasons and may take time to build up an innings load. He'll be able to start if he can command that slider to the back foot of left-handed hitters; he needs to have an out-pitch against lefties and some sort of viable third pitch, which I think will more likely be a second breaking ball than a split or a changeup. If he can do that, I think he's a 3-to-4 WAR starter. <em>(At-home dev)</em>","JXUYoulUEo8","17282"

After posting the lowest swinging strike rate in all of the minor leagues in 2019, he had the third-lowest swinging strike rate in the big leagues in 2020 at 3.3%. The players who surround him on that leaderboard -- Luis Arraez, Eric Sogard, and David Fletcher -- are all similar offensive players who make elite rates of contact but have almost no power. More precisely, Madrigal is most like Arraez because of how opposite-field oriented their contact is. If you prorate Fletcher and Arraez's performance over the past few years, they're pretty well above-average players, and Madrigal is a better defensive player than Arraez and is a wash with Fletcher at second. I just think this reinforces the industry's long-standing eyeball evaluation that even though he's quite small and is not going to hit for power, Madrigal is a very good player. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>","tQxQekapA8k","20521"

(Major league teams were skeptical of that explanation and thought his absence had to do with an off-the-field matter.) In that lone appearance this spring, Crochet threw 3.1 innings and was absolutely electric, touching 99 with his fastball while flashing a 70-grade slider. How teams valued him leading up to the draft (the relief risk, the injury or makeup issues) was highly variable. Their confidence seemed to be determined by who in the org had seen him and when (many teams weren't able to get a decision-maker to see him in person in 2020), but those that focused on his pitch data, which was shared among all the teams, thought he had among the best raw stuff in the entire draft class and was one of the few pitchers available who might pitch at the top of a rotation or in the back of a bullpen. Crochet was also among the high-octane college pitchers thought capable of going straight to the big leagues in a relief role, something more broadly considered by clubs due to the structure of the 2020 player pool. Out of Burl Carraway, Clayton Beeter, etc., only Crochet actually did. 
After he tuned up at the alternate site for about two months, Crochet was added to the 40-man and sent to the big leagues in mid-September. He pitched six innings in five relief appearances, walked no one (though he was pretty wild if you put on the tape), allowed just three hits and no runs, and struck out eight big leaguers. He made the White Sox playoff roster but left his first career postseason outing with a flexor strain, which ended his season. He's healthy now, training and throwing at the team's complex in Arizona. Because he barely threw in 2020, he's likely to be on a strict innings limit in 2021. The club is going to try to thread the needle here and use Crochet in a relief role while still trying to develop him as a long-term starter. Players in this situation tend to wind up in the bullpen, and that's where I have Crochet projected based on his strike-throwing limitations, independent of his shortened developmental timeline. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>","SQKYGiObDos","27463"

His curveball is occasionally average but more often is below, and as breaking ball spin is seen as an attribute a pitching prospect either has or doesn't, the ceiling on that pitch is likely limited. If the curveball, or some other breaking ball, can become average, then Kelley can be a mid-rotation starter. If not, he has late-inning relief stuff. Kelley is also a bigger, heavier kid without a modicum of positive physical projection left unless you're a proponent of ""reverse projection,"" where you project on a player based on the assumption that they'll improve their conditioning in pro ball. This has happened with Forrest Whitley, Bo Bichette, and others. Even if this were to occur here, though, I'm not sure it will make a difference in the area of import, which for Kelley is his breaking ball quality. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>","pdY_rmrCjTc","sa3014471"

Once parked in the 97-102 range, he was living 90-92 early on in the 2018 Fall League and was shut down with fatigue. In 2019, he was back in the 94-97 range, topping out at 99, then sat 96-99 and touched 100 during his 2020 big league debut. Burdi was knocked around in a limited major league jaunt and his velocity slowly declined (though always remained good) during that stretch. Just based on his -- and perhaps unfairly, his brother's -- injury history, I think the industry will always value Burdi a little lower than his talent, which is that of a late-inning reliever. 
It's odd and perhaps a bit of a yellow flag that he was hit so hard in 2020, but I'm still betting on the combination of velocity and two good secondary pitches and project Burdi as a third bullpen banana. His slider is short and cuttery but it's really hard, in the 88-92 mph range, and it has biting two-plane movement when it's located right. His low-90s changeup also has bat-missing tail. All three pitches are capable of missing bats, Burdi just needs to execute more consistently. During his big league action this year, I noticed he'd alter his position on the rubber depending on the handedness of the opposing hitter. I don't know how long Burdi has been doing that or if it's a thing he's yet comfortable with, so perhaps he experienced a learning/feel curve in 2020. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>","qjlYWTBkyNQ","19159"

He was a good bit more physical than most of his peers in that league, listed at a sturdy 6-foot-4, 215 pounds. But he was also a bit raw from a baseball standpoint though he still had success in general, and with his swing decisions in particular. He did not have the opportunity to come stateside until Fall Instructional League 2020 and his name is one of the first out of scouts' mouths when you ask them about who they liked from Chicago's Autumn group. 
He has overt power projection because of his frame, though with the added strength and power comes a corner-only profile. Scouts talk about Bailey's likely eventual size as if he's going to be built like Franmil Reyes, so there's a chance he flirts with a DH-only defensive outcome. Regardless of whether he ends up in an outfield corner or without a real position, Bailey is going to have to hit. For a long-levered player who has less in-game experience than most who are the age of a college freshman, Bailey's feel for the barrel is pretty good. He's now had success against both same-aged but more experienced players in the DSL and against an Instructional League pitching pool that was unusually advanced due to a lack of minor league season. Without a valuable defensive role to fall back on, Bailey is a high-variance prospect who'll either hit enough to play every day or not. He's one of few prospects in the system who has that sort of ceiling at all and his bat-to-ball skills are better than all of the others. Were he a domestic prospect, Bailey would be the sort who goes in the third round of the draft. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3009343"

He manipulates the bat head's depth and direction to get the sweet spot to pitches all over the zone. He loads his hands pretty deep, but because he's such a short-levered guy, Rodriguez is still able to catch velocity despite this. He's clearly gotten stronger and twitchier during the last year and showed up to Fall Instructional League looking more muscular and mature than in 2019. I think he's an athletic fit on the middle infield though he perhaps doesn't have quiet the arm for shortstop. That may have come with the added strength but I did not see this group in the Fall. I'd like to see him be more selective, but the combination of feel to hit and defensive projection give Sanchez a shot to be a consistent, role-playing middle infielder of some kind. He has an outside shot at being a regular if he can continue to become more physical. The trajectory he's on in this regard has already surpassed what I expected after seeing him in the AZL last year. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3005788"

He was assigned to Estrellas Orientales in the Dominican Winter League just before the initial publication of Chicago's list but hasn't played enough there to justify re-evaluation, so his report remains the same. Adolfo has been around for so long that even though he's missed a lot of time due to injury, we have a pretty good idea of what he is. Here's the rundown: Adolfo missed most of 2015 due to a gruesome leg fracture, broke his hamate a month into 2016, played through an elbow injury that required Tommy John in 2018, then missed most of 2019 due to arthoscopic surgery on that same elbow, before being limited to the alt site for 2020. Amid these long stretches of inactivity, Adolfo got big and buff (he nows tips the scales at a listed 255 pounds) but also pretty stiff, and while the White Sox have maintained that they'd like him to play the outfield, he's one of several heavy-footed DH types on the 40-man. 
Adolfo has the raw power to clear that (or any) offensive bar, but he's had strikeout issues throughout his career and except for the last few injury-riddled seasons (small sample alert), he's been a hedonistic free swinger. He's run close to an 11% walk rate in his last 550 plate appearances, which is double the rate he posted from 2014 to 2017. It would give him a better chance of playing a consistent role if that increase in patience is real and sustains. The power gives Adolfo a chance to have some 2019 Jorge Soler type seasons while his whiffs make him a high variance hitter likely to have several replacement-level campaigns as well. He's in the White Sox mix for a power bench bat and occasional DH. <em>(Alternate site, LIDOM)</em>","8ZZLd5q2F1Y","sa830303"

That variability has followed him into pro ball where, even during a fairly brief instructs run in the Fall, Thompson's fastball was either up to 95 or 96, or living in the 90-92 range depending on when he was seen. (This was well after he was added to the 60-man player pool in early-August, so he'd had time to get ramped up for the Fall.) Perhaps mechanical changes, aiming to simplify Thompson's delivery and make it more consistent, are at work; his delivery is super smooth but he didn't repeat it consistently as an amateur. Regardless, he remains a good long-term pitching prospect who has enough physical projection left to allow us to dream on him routinely throwing hard. He just hasn't had the opportunity to cut it loose and prove he can do it over a full season of pro starter's innings yet. His FV remains the same as last year. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3011866"

That's mostly held true more than a year after he was drafted, except I saw more release point variability (as if to vary the shape of his breaking ball) and a longer arm action (which makes me less likely to project heavily on the changeup) than was described in my amateur notes. But again, Dalquist's report remains similar to last offseason's write-up. He's well-balanced over the rubber and has advanced fastball and breaking ball control. He'll likely end up with two viable breaking balls even if the changeup doesn't develop, which will be fine for thwarting lefties so long as they're located well, which they project to be. Because Dalquist is of narrow build, he doesn't have the fastball projection of most other, recently-drafted pitchers (especially since he's already 20) and projects toward the back of a rotation. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>","rHQg9uD-l7U","sa3011841"

As the temperature climbed, so too did Stiever's velocity, and he started pounding the zone with 92-95, peaking at 97. In a season split between Low- and Hi-A, Stiever struck out 154 hitters and walked just 27 in 145 innings and became one of the org's better starting pitching prospects. Then he was shut down with forearm soreness toward the end of 2020's original spring training and didn't re-emerge until September, when the team called him up from the alternate site to make a few September starts, which was instructive because we got to see his velocity coming off of the forearm soreness that ended his spring. He sat 91-94, which is a little below his peak 2019 breakout when he would touch those 6’s and 7’s. His changeup looked better, though, and it was a stabilizing force during a jittery first start. 
He’ll need to locate his slider more consistently for it to be effective, and the same goes for his heater if it’s going to live around 93 rather than well into the mid-90s. Stiever also incorporated his secondary stuff more often in his second outing. That’s probably the long-term strategy if this is where his fastball velocity is going to live, but both his breaking ball and fastball spin were down about 200 rpm each compared to the 2019 minor league data I have. Based on his 2020 look, Stiever is a 40 FV backend starter. If he reclaims his 2019 velocity, he's a 45 FV, but that year is the one that, based on his career norms, appears to be the outlier right now. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>",,"24584"

Indeed, for his age, Ramos is already a sizable guy. Perhaps tricked by the way his fire engine red batting gloves stood out against Chicago's black and gray instructs threads, I thought he had the most explosive hands of that group, and I like how bold his stride is, even though some of his swings are reckless.

I wrote last year that Mercedes is built such that he looks ripped and fat at the same time, and if you've been watching him catch for Licey in the Dominican Winter League, you can see he's begun to trend toward the latter. It doesn't matter all that much though because, anticipated rule changes or not, he can't catch, nor can he really play first base. Instead, his is a DH-only profile with serious strength, bat speed, and hand-eye coordination that might enable him to play a valuable situational role if he can overcome a propensity to chase. It's not as if the Yermínator lacks any kind of approach. With two strikes, he ditches his huge leg kick and focuses on putting the ball in play with just his hands and wrists, and he often still hits the ball hard like this because he's so strong. 
Perhaps he'll have some trade value once baseball moves to a universal designated hitter but I tend to think Mercedes' epicurean sensibilities at the plate would undermine his ability to play every day. Instead, I think if he's deployed in situations where the opposing pitcher can't pitch around him and has to throw strikes, he'll be a very, very dangerous late-game hitter.

He stands way off the dish, which creates some quality-of-contact limitations on pitches away from him in exchange for an ability to open up and turn on inside pitches with authority. It's an approach that's typically shiftable, but Gonzalez is also a good bunter and runs well to combat this.

I've been watching Rutherford since his junior year of high school and he has always had a gorgeous low-ball swing that at times is suited for him slicing pitches away from him to the opposite field. I was as enamored with Rutherford's swing and big frame during his prep days as anyone, but my thinking around swings like this has changed, even if Rutherford's report hasn't. I've never seen him really impact a ball that he hasn't gotten fully extended on, and I don't see a way of getting him to pull more without losing that that extension. Anecdotally, longer-swinged hitters seem to be better at hitting breaking balls and offspeed stuff than fastballs, and perhaps as baseball shifts toward a pitching approach that throws more breaking balls, hitters like Rutherford will actually be in a metagame position to succeed, but I'm skeptical.

At the same time, this is the sort of player who the year away from seeing pro pitching probably hurts the most, and the kind of player who a shorter draft and a more limited number of minor league roster spots will also hurt. As a hitter, Beard is more like a five o'clock shadow, one of the least-experienced bats to appear on a team's list this year. But of all the young hitters in this org, he has the greatest chance of staying up the middle because his speed almost guarantees he'll stay in center field forever. He's a half-decade dev project with the speed to be a leadoff pest. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3010038"

Because Johnson was hurt for most of the pre-deadline part of the 2019 season he wasn't widely seen until the Fall League, where he struggled to throw strikes. He is athletically built but doesn't have an athletic delivery. He has a very casual, very terse stride that cuts him off and forces him to throw across his body. It's weird and disorienting the first few times you see it, which makes the 93-95 fastballs Johnson throws catch you off guard. He'll flash a plus breaking ball, but that was also inconsistent in Fall. He's a 40 FV from a stuff and deception perspective, though industry feedback (the AFL look was bad) mostly had him in the tier beneath this one. <em>(Alternate site)</em>",,"sa915688"

He does have good bat control and makes mid-flight adjustments to breaking balls, which he has the raw strength to punish even if the timing of his lower half has been compromised. He's a good hitter, just one I'm skeptical will clear the offensive bar at first base without trading some contact for power, which hasn't happened yet. He got some run in the outfield during Instructional League, and if he proves capable of playing there then he belongs up in the Gonzalez/Rutherford area. If you stand back and take a bird's eye view of the profile, this is a 24-year-old who hasn't slugged over .415 in pro ball yet and now occupies a 40-man spot on a club that has several other hitters just like him. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa829797"

I do not think he'll hit enough to play a big league role, though. His long, noisy swing causes him to be late on velocity and Cespedes hasn't played or seen live pitching regularly for nearly four years, and when he has played, he's struck out a bunch. The error bar around Cuban players is big because the context in which they're evaluated is often strange, but I'm pessimistic about the bat based on the info I have.",,

He was a 2020 non-roster invitee but blew out and needed Tommy John in February, missing the entire season. And yet there was some light industry buzz that he was being talked about as a Rule 5 Draft sleeper because Schyver's pitch data is superlative in a specific way. Namely, his release point is really, really high (top 20 among minor league lefties in 2019) and yet, because he doesn't take much of a stride down the mound, his extension is just a shade over five feet, which is very low. His release point is unique due to this combination, and it creates really weird angle on his fastball, which spins a lot relative to its velocity. Conversely, his slider has almost no spin. It's weird. He's a sleeper who I expect will be at least an up/down option year reliever. <em>(Injury)</em>",,"sa873263"

He sat 92-95 and touched 97 in rookie ball and flashed a plus breaking ball. The pandemic made it tough for pro dev take-a-leap guys everywhere to break out. Freeman was working with two different breaking balls in the Fall, but he was a little wild again and he may always be, as his arm action is long.

The cause? A slight uptick in velocity paired with an arm slot change that has him coming straight over the top, creating more life on his heater; it also creates more vertical action on his breaking stuff. This delivery appears tough to maintain, as Lambert has to contort his body to get to that slot, but he hasn't been wild since making the change. In 2019, he tore his UCL and needed Tommy John in June. I assumed that would cost him all of 2020, but he went to the Sox alternate site and actually made his big league debut in July of 2020. After just two outings, though, he was again shut down with a forearm strain and put on the 60-day IL. (For The Board, I'm using pitch data I have from 2019 rather than what he generated in a two-inning, perhaps somewhat injured big league sample in 2020.)

Horn won a rotation spot in the Fall of 2019 then came out touching 96 as a junior and had four really good starts before the shut down.

He had a strong pro debut on paper and continued to look good with the bat during the spring of 2019, then struggled during the summer. The general scouting consensus is that Bush will not stay at his current third base and will have to move to an outfield corner or to first, which immediately makes his whiffs troublesome.

He's a strong guy who strides way open as he tries to pull everything with power, an all-or-nothing approach.

Burger's play and Chicago's late-summer 60-man pool space enabled them to roster him at the alternate site toward the end of the season before he went to instructs in the Fall. 
He's leaner and more mobile than scouts anticipated, evidence of the work he put in during his unthinkable series of misfortunes. The Sox added him to the 40-man in November. While his story of perseverance is remarkable, and all of baseball is rooting for the guy, who seems like an affable and funny young man, he's unlikely to make a long-term big league impact. I was on the low end of projecting Burger while he was in college, skeptical of his ability to play third even before all the injuries. Now, his swing path is also a bit of an issue. He should be given an opportunity to claim that bench power bat spot but I think others in the org are more likely to do so. <em>(CarShield Collegiate League, alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>","s3XP82oUmfQ","sa915698"
