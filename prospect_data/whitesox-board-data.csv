The changes, based on my notes, are subtle. A narrower base, a little bit deeper load to the hands, and a front side that stays closed a little longer. These are relatively small tweaks to a swing that is comically simple, but the results -- his 2018 groundball rate was between 44-50% depending on the level, while his 2019 rates were 26-32% -- were astounding. It's terrifying that Robert can generate the kind of power he does with such a conservative stride back toward the pitcher, and it juxtaposes with many of the movement-heavy swings that have been pervasive throughout baseball since Josh Donaldson and José Bautista broke out. 
Robert does have plate discipline issues. He chases a lot of breaking balls out of the zone and it took a lot of convincing from industry folks to move him as high on my Top 100 as I did even though Robert has the surface-level traits that tend to make me irrationally excited. He has one of the best physiques in pro sports, he's a plus-plus runner, and his instincts in center field are terrific. The power production and OBP may be somewhat limited by the approach, very similarly to how Starling Marte's have been, but Marte is a 60, so here we are.","yolHGuJGfEk","sa3003396"

Pleasant HS (TX)","Just as Kopech seemed to be harnessing his hellacious stuff, he blew out. In the seven minor league starts before his big league debut, he walked just four batters, and was similarly efficient in his first few big league outings. But in his final start, the Tigers shelled him and his velocity was down; an MRI revealed he would need Tommy John. The timing was particularly cruel, not just because things had started to click, but also because late-season TJs usually cost the pitcher all of the following year, and indeed, Kopech didn't throw in a game environment until the 2019 instructional league. His first fastball in the fall? Ninety-nine miles per hour, and he sat 94-99 on the Camelback Ranch backfields.
His stuff is great, headlined by a mid-90s fastball that often crests 100 mph. The command inroads Kopech made late in 2018 are especially important for his ability to deal with lefties, because his changeup feel is not very good. He'll need to mix his two breaking balls together to deal with them, and his slider feel is way ahead of the curveball. So long as Kopech's stuff returns, he has No. 3 starter ceiling if the command comes with it, and high-leverage relief ability if it does not.","JXUYoulUEo8","17282"

Vaughn started seeing a lot of breaking balls once conference play began -- about 15% fewer fastballs to be more exact. He was pitched around and unable to make as much impact contact, but all the tools were still there. Vaughn has a very selective approach, letting strikes he can't drive pass him by unless he has to put a ball in play, a skill I compared before the draft to Paul Konerko's (I mentioned this to a Special Assistant who scoffed and said he thought Vaughn was way better). He has a very athletic swing despite being decidedly unathletic in every other way, enabling all fields power and high rates of contact. 
There's no margin for error for right-handed hitting first baseman, but if there's one prospect to be confident in hitting as much as is necessary to profile at first, it's someone with this combination of visual evaluation and statistical track record. Vaughn's post-draft TrackMan data is also supportive, and suggests he could be a .300/.400/.500 hitter. How fast he comes up and where he plays when he arrives (it's 1B/DH but José Abreu exists, Edwin Encarnación is on a one-year deal, Eloy Jiménez might have a DH body soon, Micker Adolfo already does, and Nomar Mazara was added this winter) will be dictated by those around him.","cPv9SsBcKQk","sa3011226"

Short players have short swings and Madrigal is no exception. He pulled and lifted the ball more last season than he did the year before, but unless the big league baseball is particularly kind to about a dozen of Magic Man's wall-scraping fly balls, he doesn't project to hit for more than doubles power. That's fine, though. Second base has the lowest league-wide wRC+ of all the non-catching positions right now and several punchless contact hitters have had good careers (Arraez was a 2 WAR player in 90 games, Joe Panik was a 50 FV, etc.), and most all of them are nowhere near the runner or defender that Madrigal is -- he has some of the fastest hands I've seen around the bag, and he's going to steal outs because of how quickly he turns feeds from Tim Anderson around to first base. He doesn't have a high ceiling because of the lack of power but I consider Madrigal a low-variance, above-average regular at second.","tQxQekapA8k","sa3008139"

In his one appearance Crochet threw 3.1 innings and was absolutely electric, touching 99 and flashing a 70-grade slider. How teams value him (relief risk, injury or makeup issues) is highly variable but those focused on his pitch data think he has among the best raw stuff in the class and is one of the few pitchers available who might pitch at the top of a rotation or in the back of a bullpen.",,

He took a big step forward during his freshman year at Florida, though the rest of the talent on that pitching staff pushed him to a bullpen/midweek/spot starting role for much of his career. The industry still valued him in the first round by the time he was a junior, and Washington selected him 29th overall in 2016, before trading him that winter for eventual title contributor Adam Eaton. 
Dunning had a very strong 2017, when his prospect value hit its pinnacle; he was viewed as a near-ready No. 4 starter and a core part of Chicago's rebuild. Then he missed the second half of 2018 with an elbow strain and tore his UCL during 2019 spring training, which required surgery. He was slated to be back midway through 2020 and in late February was throwing live BP, during which his fastball velo sat in the low-90s. He's thrown side sessions since baseball's shut down. It'll have to involve backfield rehab outings during whatever weird, abbreviated season we're about to have, but I think it's likely Dunning plays some kind of role on the staff this year, even if it's just as a spot starter. His long-term outlook is that of a no. 4/5 starter.",,"sa738926"

His curveball is occasionally average but more often is below, and breaking ball spin is seen as something a pitching prospect either has or does not, so the ceiling on that pitch is viewed as limited. If the curveball can be average then Kelley can be a mid-rotation starter. If not, he has late-inning relief stuff.","pdY_rmrCjTc",

As the temperature climbed, so too did Stiever's velocity, and he started pounding the zone with 92-95, peaking at 97. In a season split between Low- and Hi-A, Stiever struck out 154 hitters and walked just 27 in 145 innings and became one of the org's better starting pitching prospects. The velocity (assuming it holds), Stiever's plus curveball, and his strike-throwing ability all already fit a big league bullpen role, and potentially a significant one if one-inning, max-effort outings enable more velocity. For Stiever to profile as a league-average starter, his slider and/or changeup need to improve. Those two pitches were slated to be a developmental focus for the right-hander this season, but we didn't get a look at them during the spring because Stiever was shut down with a forearm soreness.",,"sa3007233"

Both his elite approach (a 19% career walk rate since his freshman year at Miami) and power still exist and drive what should be a valuable part-time role as a first baseman, (bad) catcher, and DH. He and Yermin Mercedes are arguably redundant and project to play a similar role, with Collins' lefty bat and the two year age difference between them driving me to order them like this.","fK2DsmC5BT0","19181"
"Yermin Mercedes","CHW","DH",,,10,,"40+",2020,,"27.4166666","5' 11""","225","R","R",2010,"J2","WAS",,"Dominican Republic","I believe Mercedes will one day be a Chicago sports cult hero. He's highly entertaining and talented enough to play a relevant big league role despite being a total defensive misfit. Stout and beefy, Mercedes is built such that he looks ripped and fat at the same time. He has a needlessly noisy, punk rock swing (until he has two strikes, which I'll get to) with a big leg kick and all kinds of pre-swing bat waggling, but it always pauses with Mercedes balanced, his hands in good position, ready to unload on the baseball, which he often does. Mercedes ditches the leg kick with two strikes, but he's so strong that he puts balls in play -- hard -- without it. 
His route to the precipice of the big leagues has been scenic. After three years with Washington, Mercedes was cut and spent 2014 in Indy ball, including time in the Pecos League with the White Sands Pupfish. Baltimore signed him and had him for two years before losing him to Chicago in the 2017 minor league Rule 5 Draft. 
Mercedes has now hit his way up the ladder (a .302/.366/.491 career line, including those mediocre years with Washington that brought about his release) and has big league offensive ability -- he just cannot catch. While he presents strikes to umpires well on occasion, he'll also just totally whiffs sometimes and is constantly running to the backstop. Craig Littleman, a former coworker of mine who played for White Sands with Mercedes in 2014, told me even that team was trying to hide him on defense. He also said Mercedes was by far the team's smartest, most talented hitter. I'm not anticipating Mercedes will be able to catch every day once automated strike zones come about, but I do think it gives him a better chance to do so once in a while and that he'll hit enough as a DH/1B to play a part-time role anyway. Plus, he has real value as a trade chip if the universal DH is ever instituted. He's a good, relevant hitting prospect despite his age.",,"sa597096"

His fastball has impact tailing movement -- among the most lateral movement in the minors -- and he also has a weird, high-spin changeup that could be plus. I think he has a shot to be a set-up type.","VjNkEUlACUY","sa3006764"

Here's the rundown: Adolfo missed most of 2015 due to a gruesome leg fracture, broke his hamate a month into 2016, played through an elbow injury that required Tommy John in 2018, then missed most of 2019 due to arthoscopic surgery on that elbow. Amid these long stretches of inactivity, Adolfo got big and buff (he nows tips the scales at a listed 255 -- as a comical aside, Eloy Jiménez is listed at 205) but also pretty stiff, and while the White Sox have maintained that they'd like him to play the outfield, he's one of several heavy-footed DH types on the 40-man. 
Adolfo has the raw power to clear that (or any) offensive bar, but he's had strikeout issues throughout his career and except for the last few, injury-riddled seasons (small sample alert), he's been a hedonistic free swinger. He's run close to an 11% walk rate in his last 550 plate appearances, which is double the rate he posted from 2014 to 2017. It would give him a better chance of playing a consistent role if that increase in patience is real and sustains. The power gives Adolfo a chance to have some 2019 Jorge Soler type seasons while his whiffs make him a high variance hitter likely to have several replacement-level campaigns as well. He's younger than Collins and Mercedes but I'm more confident that their headlining skills will play in big league games.","8ZZLd5q2F1Y","sa830303"

The Platonic ideal of this sort of player (45 FV) is Seth Smith, who I think has more raw power than Rutherford. Also, Rutherford's swing is geared for low-ball contact, which is less useful in the game now than it was five or 10 years ago, as pitchers more often attack with velo at the top of the zone.

His upper-80s slider is a gravity ball that spins at just 1600 rpm. It seems to work as long as Hamilton locates it, but his delivery is pretty hard to repeat.

But of all the young hitters in this org, he has the greatest chance of staying up the middle because his speed almost guarantees he'll stay in center field forever.

In 2018,that abated and he was dominant, quickly moving to Double-A. Last year, again, Thompson looked good from a stuff perspective but got hit around. His fastball/slider combination is 40 FV worthy but he just hasn't performed like a slam dunk relief piece and the industry passed on him in the Rule 5.",,"sa602893"

He's a strong guy who strides way open as he tries to pull everything with power, an all-or-nothing approach. Like Bryce Bush before him, Gladney will be tried at third base for a while but may not stay there. He's a high risk corner power prospect.",,"sa3010043"

But he put on an absolute show during batting practice and has one of the best raw power projections among potential future Sox. He had a strong pro debut on paper and continued to look good with the bat during the spring of 2019, then struggled during the summer. The general scouting consensus is that Bush will not stay at his current third base and will have to move to an outfield corner or to first, which immediately makes his whiffs troublesome. He's a high-risk, long-term developmental prospect with some of the louder offensive tools in the system.",,"sa3008278"

It was more of the same in 2019 as Hansen, now in the bullpen, continued to struggle with walks and was eventually passed over in the Rule 5. That we've seen 94-97 with a plus breaking ball in the past means we may again, but the 2019 velo/command combo isn't going to cut it.","VQzZu_90hZk","sa738344"

The cause? A slight uptick in velocity paired with an arm slot change that has him coming straight over the top, creating more life on his heater. It also creates more vertical action on his breaking stuff. This delivery appears tough to maintain, as Lambert has to contort his body to get to that slot, but he hasn't been wild since making the change. Lambert tore his UCL after 11 starts and needed Tommy John last June, which likely would have cost him all of 2020.
