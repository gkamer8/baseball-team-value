Garcia struggled in his initial 24-game, 68-plate appearance big league trial, hitting just .194 and striking out 38% of the time. The issue that plagued him was the same one he had in the minors: an inability to recognize breaking stuff. He paid for it more consistently against big league pitchers, who can execute consistently and exploit such a weakness. 
But let's not lose sight of the pretty incredible collection of tools here. Garcia has above-average raw power right now and I think he has the frame to add another half grade as he enters his mid-20s. He's also a fantastic shortstop defender despite middling speed and range (at least in 2020) because he has plus-plus hands, actions, and arm strength. He's going to backhand balls in the hole and throw out guys few other shortstops in baseball would be able to hose. Also remember that Garcia is about the age of the college players who were just drafted, and it would be ridiculous to expect even someone like Spencer Torkelson to skip Double- and Triple-A and immediately succeed. I think Garcia is going to end up punishing mistakes on the inner half with power and swinging at inside breaking balls away from him en route to a power/defense-driven everyday role, and he has long-term All-Star ceiling if his approach improves. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em> ","oe9MB7KStTA","23378"
"Tyler Stephenson","CIN","C","MLB",78,2,,"50",2021,"Med","24.8027777","6' 4""","225","R","R",2015,"Draft","CIN",3140000,"Kennesaw Mountain HS (GA)","Initially called up when Tucker Barnhart went on the Paternity List, Stephenson got an eight-game cup of coffee in the big leagues, but only a three-game shot of espresso at catcher. It'd be foolish to construct a new opinion of his offense from an eight-game statistical sample but it was instructive to watch him catch most of a big league staff during those three games behind the plate. 
Stephenson catches on one knee with the bases empty, then from a crouch with runners on. For most fastballs, his glove works from the middle of the plate outward, and for breaking balls he typically works from beneath the zone, up. The latter is more effective from a pitch-framing perspective, but both approaches are fine from a receiving standpoint, which was an issue for Stephenson as a younger prospect. So, too, was ball-blocking. Stephenson is 6-foot-4 and his wickets are pretty big. His legs often get down late when he has to block a ball, but they're so long that he ends up having good lateral range by using his length to slide around. Even then, Stephenson mostly tries to use his glove to pick balls in the dirt rather than get his knees down and pads over the ball, which may affect pitcher confidence in his ability to block balls. Stephenson avoids tipping pitches with runners on base. His legs bow out wide when a breaking ball is coming, but it happens too late for the baserunner to signal the hitter. I suppose we don't know how well he will be able to block the nastiest of breaking balls, but I think he clearly looks capable of catching and will be at least an average defender with a big time arm. 
Offensively, Stephenson puts on quite a show during batting practice but has a contact-oriented approach in games. Per a source, he had one of the better in-zone contact rates in the 2019 minors, which is quite the opposite of how most of the amateur side of the industry thought he would develop as a pro. It's possible he eventually makes an adjustment that unlocks more in-game power, but I think a contact-first approach that derives power from Stephenson's strength is still plenty for him to profile as a good, everyday catcher. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>","HDhq33FljWA","17988"

He went wire to wire as one of the best prep prospects in his class from basically his sophomore year on. He was drafted second in the 2017 class as a pitcher, and he began dominating in his first full season (especially with his fastball) as he was allowed to go deeper into Low-A games in May and June of 2018, which culminated in a seven-inning shutout (2 H, 0 BB, 10 K, and all in just 69 pitches) on July 2 against Cleveland's affiliate, and then a legendary Futures Game appearance during which he sat 99-102 in front of the whole world. Eleven days later, Greene's season was over. He had a PRP injection and rehabbed, but he ended up having surgery in April of 2019 and did not pitch in a live setting again until he was at the Reds' alternate site during the pandemic. 
Perhaps the individual baseball timelines least-impacted by the pandemic were those of injured pitchers whose years were already going to take a predictable shape in a rehab and development-focused environment. By throwing in California and then at the alternate site, Greene performed some facsimile of what he would have otherwise done in 2020. But it will still be nearly two years between when he last threw a pitch in a minor league game and when he will again, delaying and complicating the arc of a very talented prospect. Here's another complication: Greene's arm slot is now lower than it was before he got hurt. Significantly lower. His arm slot now looks more like it did when he was in high school, creating tailing action rather than carry on his fastball. It might impact how well his fastball plays, even though he was throwing really hard at the alt site, but we won't really know until he's made some 2021 minor league starts. The new-ish slot has also aided the action on Greene's breaking stuff. He's added a former cutter/slider to his original, slurvy breaker. The layoff and change in mechanics add degrees of variance (and probably added relief risk) to a profile that already included a lot of it, but I ultimately have faith in Greene's combination of elite ability and seemingly strong desire to be really good, so I continue to project that he will be. <em>(Alternate site)</em>","tKAAzmpe180","sa3005315"

He had iffy freshman and sophomore seasons but flashed a tantalizing blend of stuff and feel at times, keeping him in the first round mix despite inconsistent performance. As a junior, everything clicked for him during a heavily-scouted, early-season college tournament in Houston, where Lodolo worked in the mid-90s with a plus breaking ball and changeup and struck out 13 Houston Cougars in seven innings. He'd end up posting career-best numbers across the board and was drafted seventh overall in 2019. After the draft, Lodolo pitched a total of 18 innings between Billings and Dayton, his fastball resting in the 92-94 range.  
Lodolo threw in one pre-shutdown spring training game and in one summer camp tuneup, and neither went well. He showed up to summer camp looking kind of soft and with diminished velocity, and he paid for it early on in a scrimmage against the Tigers during which he surrendered back to back to back homers and couldn't make it out of the second inning. Lodolo slowly began rebuilding arm strength throughout the summer and was back into his usual range by the end of his run at the alt site. His arm slot is abnormally low for a starter but when he's throwing well, he has great east/west command of his fastball and can back door his curveball for strikes on the arm-side corner of the plate. He still needs to more consistently bury that curveball in the dirt for swings and misses; to my eye it looks like it should present tough angle for righty hitters when it's located to their back foot. While Lodolo would sometimes go entire outings without throwing many changeups as an amateur, there were stretches when it was his best pitch, and the cambio was a developmental focus at the alt site. The entire package reads like a suitable fourth starter. When Lodolo is in shape, his frame is ideal, his delivery elegant and repeatable. The stuff isn't dominant, but some teams are still projecting on it because of how big and lean Lodolo's frame is, which makes them think it might be eventually. <em>(Alternate site)</em>","iUFDfzPzh74","sa917947"

It is somewhat concerning that Hendrick was not only older than most of his elite high school peers on the 2020 Draft showcase circuit but that he was older and still swung and missed a lot during that stretch. This, combined with his corner outfield defensive projection, makes him a prospect of extreme variance and risk since he'll need to really rake to be an everyday player. But he also tinkered with his swing during that pre-draft summer and at times it had ridiculous length and noise it's unlikely to once he has received pro instruction for a while. Plus, he was coming from Western Pennsylvania varsity ball, which is not nearly as good as that in the Southeast, Texas or California, which is where most of his opponents were from during the 2020 process. Let's also not lose sight of Hendrick's ability. He was the most explosive rotator in the entire 2020 class (and it really wasn't close) regardless of demographic, and carried among the biggest raw power projections because of his big, square-shouldered frame. He needs reps against good pitching, and time to adjust to what will likely be some initial failure. He got his first exposure to it during instructs and responded pretty well. He'll stay in the 45+ FV tier along with similar high-variance and high-risk prospects until he builds a statistical foundation in pro ball. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em>","ZBiRPVgPvHQ","sa3014521"

He trained at Cressey Sports Performance in Florida during most of the summer, and worked about 40 innings in a live setting there before being part of a recently-drafted contingent of 20-ish-year-olds who went to the Reds' alt site later in the season. There Richardson hit his innings mark for the year and did not continue on to Instructs. 
He was one of my 2020 Picks to Click, my gut feel guys who I predict will make the following year's top 100, but while Richardson was throwing hard during 2020 spring training and throughout the year, we haven't seen him do that over an actual slate of starter's innings. He's had some variation in velocity the last few years and the Reds had to shut him down due to elbow soreness toward the end of his draft year; he was 89-93 while working a really healthy, 26-start slate in his first full season. He found ways to get outs in 2019, even with diluted stuff, then threw harder in a more controlled setting in 2020. He's athletic, still somewhat new to pitching full-time, and competitive, often emotional and demonstrative on the mound. He projects as a well-rounded fourth starter but needs to show the velo gains are going to stick. <em>(Alternate site)</em>","A6viDU8LwwU","sa3007727"

These evaluations are especially important drivers for my opinion regarding India, who was coming off a nagging wrist injury that impacted his performance and ultimately ended his 2019 season (a lat issue ended his 2020). I've been a fairly staunch India skeptic, pointing to his draft year campaign as the anomaly among seasons of otherwise pedestrian output. There's renewed scout confidence in India's bat, at least from a contact perspective. He squared up the player pool pitching at Prasco Park pretty well but the exit velo data from the site is middling, at least at the top end of India's exit velocities. He also may not throw well enough to play third base, or have the range to play second, so I think there's increased risk that he ends up spending most of his time in left field, and I don't think he will have the power to profile as an everyday player there. But I think he might accidentally back into some prized defensive versatility by virtue of the Reds trying him all over the field, and end up playing a valuable multi-positional -- but ultimately bat-centric -- role. He just turned 24 and still hasn't had meaningful at-bats above A-ball. <em>(Alternate site)</em>","KPK-GaBvm6U","21523"

He mostly played third base in high school, but there were some pre-draft calls for him to catch, and the Reds gave him post-draft reps at second and continued doing so during the Fall of 2020 since they wanted to give Rece Hinds as many opportunities at third as possible. I've gotten mixed reviews on how his glove looked at second, including some positive thoughts from outside the org. There's also a chance he's eventually a first baseman; for now I have him projected as a below-average second baseman. 
But the bat is the carrying tool here. Callihan was one of the most polished high school hitters in the 2019 class, and performed against his elite peers on the showcase circuit. There was some merited skepticism surrounding his ability to sustain that in pro ball since Callihan was among the older high schoolers in that class, but now that he's performed against more refined pro arms for over a year and is generating the same reports, it's fair to be more confident in the stick. If he can stand at second then there's much less need to alter Callihan's swing to increase his power output. <em>(Alternate site from mid-September on, Fall Instructional League)</em>","B4jwRRO_4sw","sa1169610"

Hinds has improved as a defender. His arm is an antidote for some of what he lacks in flexibility and range, and he can make a subset of plays at third base pretty well. On hotshots and anything that requires him to bend or vary the pace of his footwork, he struggles. I wrote him up as a right fielder last year, and I still think either that or first base are his ultimate destinations, but he's upped his chances of staying at third in the last year and it's important to note things are moving in that direction. The hit/power strengths and weaknesses looked the same during instructs. Hinds had the best raw power in the 2019 high school class (so ridiculous he hit a broken bat homer during instructs) but struck out a lot in the showcase setting. He has fair barrel control but stuff on the inner half ties him up due to length in his swing, especially when he tries to get the barrel to something down, and that length and middling breaking ball recognition drive the swing and miss issues. The corner fit and strikeout issues ordinarily place a prospect like this in the 40+ FV tier while they're in the lower levels, but I like some of the underlying hitting elements and the way he's worked to stay alive at third enough to slide him into the tier above that. <em>(Alternate site from mid-August on, Fall Instructional League)</em>","SXH2anSONig","sa1169587"

He has late-inning relief potential, and even though there's risk his stuff doesn't totally come back after surgery (this guy is either an elite natural athlete or has worked to sculpt his body into one of the best in the minors, and either would give me confidence that his rehab will go fine) and they'll have to wait for it, others in the system just don't have that kind of ceiling. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em>","cW0FsGzgKiI","sa3004589"

Even if his walk rate comes down, Rivas does enough other stuff to contribute to a big league roster. He won't hit homers, but he stings high-quality line drive contact to all-fields and can slash doubles down the third base line. He has sufficient speed and range for the middle infield, and has experience at every position but first base and catcher, though he hasn't played the outfield since 2015.

There are several potential solutions. He might be able to just bully the extra velocity past hitters in a relief role, or he may eventually lean into the sink/tail aspects of the fastball and work off a two-seamer (Julio Teheran is actually a pretty clean athlete/delivery comp for Gutierrez).

Unlikely to crack a loaded Rays 40-man, he was a prime trade candidate who wasn't invited to Tampa Bay's alt site but was added in order to be part of a desperate trade for pitching depth in the form of Cody Reed. It was savvy for the Reds to leverage both the Rays' prospect depth and short-term, injury-related needs into a pitcher who dominated the Florida State League the year before, but O'Brien probably wasn't physically ready to throw as suddenly as he was asked to after the deal. Remember, O'Brien's velocity climbed each of the last two years and in 2019 rested comfortably in the mid-90s.

He's a classic small-school late bloomer with a good frame and athletic delivery, his stuff had been getting better for a few consecutive years like you'd hope from someone of that developmental background, and I anticipate a bounce back and eventual relief role. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em> ",,"sa3004210"

He only sits in the low-90s but because he's small and pitches with such flat angle, Bailey's fastball is sneaky even though it's not all that hard. He's been a 40 FV for the longest time but it's clear the industry values him as someone who'll be optioned back and forth (he has two option years left), so he settles into the 35+ tier ahead of what I expect will be his final season of prospect eligibility. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>",,"19582"

He lost a tick off of his heater in both 2018 and '19 (from sitting 93-97 to sitting 91-96), but again this was as a starter rather than in the short-outing, piggyback-style of usage Perez enjoyed before Houston traded him to the Jays in the Roberto Osuna deal.

He's gangly and kind of stiff, and his swing has a non-traditional look to it, but he is explosive and toolsy. Remember that he's coming off a rough 2019. He hit .233/.303/.332 in the Midwest League (an 87 wRC+, by far the lowest of his career) and missed nearly a month due to a shoulder injury. He also seemed to regress athletically, and the odd swing he seemed to be succeeding with in the low minors looked more out of place in full-season ball. He was passed over in the Rule 5. I'm still on Bautista to some degree because of his raw power, straightline speed, and previously-evident bat-to-ball skills, but this won't work unless Bautista becomes much more selective, undergoes some kind of swing change, or both, and it's a bit concerning that the Reds preferred to see a bunch of undrafted free agents during the Fall rather than bring in Bautista, who clearly wasn't assured many LIDOM at-bats. <em>(LIDOM)</em>","xahLcvssUFA","sa872535"
