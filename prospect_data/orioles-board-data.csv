"Adley Rutschman","BAL","C",,5,1,,"60",2021,,"22.4388888","6' 2""","216","S","R",2019,"Draft","BAL",8100000,"Oregon State","Rutschman is the total package, a physical monster who also has superlative baseball acumen and leadership qualities. From his sophomore season onward (and arguably starting in the fall before that) Rutschman went wire-to-wire as the top draft prospect in his class, a complete player and the best draft prospect in half a decade. His entire profile is ideal. It's rare for ambidextrous swingers to have polished swings from both sides of the plate, even moreso to have two nearly identical, rhythmic swings that produce power. 
It's more atypical still for that type of hitter to be a great defender at a premium position. Rutschman has a pickpocket's sleight of hand and absolutely cons umpires into calling strikes on the edge of the zone. Resolute umpires end up hearing it from biased fans who are easier marks. Aside from two instances, all of my Rustchman pop times over three years of looks are between 1.86 and 1.95 seconds, comfortably plus timed throws often right on the bag. Rutschman has the physical tools to become the best catcher in baseball, provided he stays healthy (he had some shoulder/back stuff in college). He's also an ultra-competitive, attentive, and vocal team leader who shepherds pitchers with measured, but intense encouragement. It fires up his teammates and feels like it comes from a real place, not something he's forcing. Aside from the questions that arose as teams scrutinized Rutschman's medicals with a magnifying class before the draft (described to me as ""stuff consistent with catching and playing football"") he's a perfect prospect subject only to the risk and attrition that all catchers are.","riXzQCIbfPw","sa3011643"

Like Whitley, Rodriguez was once a hefty Texas high schooler with average stuff. A physical transformation coincided with a senior spring breakthrough, which was then bettered by cogent repertoire work in pro ball. Rodriguez's changeup, which was an afterthought back in high school, has screwball action and has become very good, very quickly. He's now tracking to have a four-pitch mix full of above-average pitches: a mid-90s fastball, a lateral, mid-80s slider, a two-plane upper-70s curveball, and the low-80s change. His delivery isn't great (there's a little bit of head whack, and Rodriguez has a tightly-wound lower half) but he's never been injured and has thrown an acceptable rate of strikes to this point. Among the highly-drafted 2018 prep arms, only Rodriguez and Simeon Woods-Richardson are trending above their pre-draft grades. Rodriguez has a No. 2/3 starter ceiling.","XVnKhGydp9Y","sa3008130"

Here's the list of lefty big league starters who throw harder than Hall, who averaged 94.9 mph on his fastball in 2019: Blake Snell. That's it. 
Because Hall's release is inconsistent, not only did his walk rate regress in 2019, but the quality of his secondary stuff was also less consistent than it was during his very dominant mid-summer stretch in 2018, when Hall's changeup clearly took a leap. Both of his secondaries are often plus; Hall simply has a higher misfire rate than most big league starters. He's still just 21 and has All-Star upside if he starts locating better, which may not come until after he has a couple big league seasons under his belt.

Mountcastle's long-awaited slide down the defensive spectrum accelerated last year. He was a woebegone, full-time shortstop until 2018 when he began playing third base, then last year he spent an overwhelming majority of his time at first base, while playing a bit at third and closing the year with a month in left field. The eerie shadow of the LF/DH projection (he's had issues throwing to first base) has loomed around Mountcastle's profile for a while now, but he keeps hitting enough for me to like him anyway. 
Mountcastle's timing is sublime, and he has one of the more picturesque righty swings in all of pro baseball, featuring a big, slow leg kick that eventually ignites his deft, explosive hands. He has great plate coverage and hits with power to all fields. Mountcastle swings a lot: He has a 4.5% career walk rate, and it's rare for DH/LF sorts to walk that little and be star-level performers. DH types with OBPs in the .310-.320 range typically max out in the 2-3 WAR range, which is where I expect Mountcastle to peak. But his contact quality is quite good, and the visual evaluation of the hit tool and on-paper performance have been strong for several years, so the degree of confidence that Mountcastle will hit is relatively high for a prospect with plate discipline issues.","Mf-E2t1dIxo","sa874734"

He's kept his big, 6-foot-3 frame lean and speedy during that time, relevant for the corner-only prospect because Kjerstad puts a lot of balls in play down both baselines and runs well enough to turn them all into extra bases. He can drop the bat head and lift balls at his knees, and also get on top of pitches at the top of the zone. It's plus bat control on a somewhat odd-looking swing. If there are concerns about Kjerstad's cut, I'm not hearing them, they're drowned out by how well he's performed. He may have been about to have a year like J.J. Bleday's 2019 in which he clearly establishes himself as the most reliable tier 2 college hitter in the draft, and teams in the top 10 may view him as such.","m8q8iZiuC60",

He's actually taller than just about every big league third baseman aside from the Brian Anderson, Hunter Dozier types who play other positions. He's a lefty stick with precocious power and a relatively projectable frame in spite of somewhat narrow shoulders. He squared up elite high school pitching all throughout his showcase summer, giving the industry confidence in the hit tool. It's reasonable to hope for his bat to profile in an everyday capacity at third base, especially if the currently historic crop of hot corner talent has started to age by the time he's ready.

He still hunts hittable pitches and can move the barrel around the zone, but this is an approach/contact-based skillset rather than one with loud, first division tools. The ball/strike diagnosis and barrel control are both enough for Diaz to play everyday, but he doesn't thump like a star corner outfielder and the injury track record is a reason to round down a bit.","cdLpzBiXeNQ","sa912848"

Their swing and approach are refined with pro instruction, and previously dormant production suddenly shows up in games. It seemed like Hays was quickly becoming this sort of player during his 2017 breakout, a power/speed monster who had one of the best statistical line in the minors that year. But an aggressive, pull-heavy approach and ankle injury derailed Hays' 2018, which was so putrid that he never got a big league look even though he'd already debuted the previous September.

His 2019 season was much better, though it too was interrupted by injury, this time a hamstring strain. Hays' swing makes him a 40 runner from home to first, but underway he's a plus runner capable of handling center field. His leaping ability should also make him a threat to rob the occasional homer. Most importantly, Hays' ability to play center field (which I've not always been optimistic about but have come around on) gives the approach issues some room to breathe on the offensive end. I still don't consider him a lock to generate everyday value because of the plate discipline, but he's talented enough to be a high-variance player who has some big years.

His upper-80s slider is terse and cuttery, the type of pitch that induces weak contact rather than whiffs, and when mixed with a more shapely curveball, keeps hitters sufficiently perplexed. The mealticket offering, though, is Baumann's fastball, which has huge carry. That pillar pitch complimented by lots of viable other elements should enable Baumann to work as a No. 4/5 starter.

Kiley and I liked him as a sandwich/early second round prospect and Stowers ended up falling all the way to the top of round three.

That's very possible for a guy who threw 60% of his fastballs in the strike zone last year. Kremer's repertoire is well-composed but relies on location to generate whiffs because his raw stuff isn't nasty enough to miss when he makes mistakes. He doesn't make many of them though, and his fastball still played against good Fall League hitters even when he sat 90-92 there. If that isn't sustainable more than twice through an order, perhaps Kremer will move to some kind of valuable long relief role eventually. For now, he's much more likely to begin his big league career in Baltimore's rotation.

His stock had a chance to continue rising as his defensive abilities at SS became more clear, and as his bat was stress-tested against SE pitching, but Servideo never got that chance.

The sinking and tailing action on Lowther's heater makes it tough to square up, and the southpaw leans on his secondary stuff to finish hitters. His curveball has depth and it bites hard, but doesn't pair very well with the sinker and is best deployed as a means to get ahead of hitters early in the count. The changeup, which Lowther uses against both-handed hitters, has become his out pitch. It's a Ryan Yarbrough sort of mix, and Lowther's future role should be similar.

He puts lots of balls in play on the ground and hauls ass to first, to this point running a nearly .400 BABIP as a pro. Hall does have advanced feel for contact for a 20-year-old with an odd developmental path (he left Bermuda as an adolescent to pursue baseball in Canada) and several catalytic qualities that fit in a traditional, perhaps regressive, top-of-the-lineup role. He's stolen 56 bases in 70 career attempts (80% success) and is fast enough for that skill to keep playing as he climbs the latter, though his offensive production will likely come down. Hall is not lacking big league physicality, but he isn't very projectable either, and what you see now is probably what you'll get.

He was a swing-change candidate for pro ball and his hands do load a little differently now, coming toward his rising front knee before circling back around in a loop toward the ball.

He made two, single-inning August rehab appearances in the GCL (a hurricane wreaked havoc on the last couple weeks of games in Florida) and then went to the Fall League, where he threw an inning every three or four days. He sat 94-97 with inconsistent slider quality and control.

After a dominant month at Hi-A to begin 2019, the Angels moved Mattson to Double-A and started varying his workload, first asking him to throw on back-to-back nights at the end of July. He's being groomed for a relief role, one that will likely be fastball-heavy. His heater has big time life at the top of the zone and Mattson really hides the ball well, so he's able to slip it past hitters at the letters. His secondary stuff is average on pure stuff but plays well off his fastball. He profiles as a middle reliever.",,"sa915667"

His frame, twitch, speed, arm strength and, shockingly, exit velos, are all of big league quality; we just know very little about the hit tool and power actualization because of his lack of reps. This is a two-year evaluation window for Baltimore because Sparks has to go on the 40-man two Decembers from now. Come June, he will have spent three years on the complex, and the track record for players who have done that is very  poor. If the Orioles like him, they have to hit the gas on his development at some point, whether that's a cup of coffee at Low-A late this year or a quick hook to Hi-A in 2021.",,"sa3004932"

Hanifee was still available the next time Baltimore was on the clock and he signed for $500,000. Our year-to-year notes on Hanifee have his velo down two ticks in 2019 (91-93 t95 in 2018, 89-92 t93 in 2019), and his control regressed, too. His appeal for the past two years had been his present arm strength and a lean, broad-shouldered, 6-foot-5 frame that foreshadowed more. That hasn't happened, even as Hanifee's gotten stronger-looking. 

His delivery is odd. After his hands break, Hanifee holds the ball out and up above his head like a waiter carrying a tray, then his stride and arm stroke are both very short. It's deceptive and strange. He's a bounceback candidate, and a reasonable outcome to hope for is a fastball-heavy reliever.",,"sa917973"

Cumberland was a bat-first catching prospect at Cal and he remains so today. He's still very rough defensively but has done nothing but catch to this point in his career. Both the receiving and arm strength are issues, so I've got Cumberland evaluated as a DH. Robo zone implementation might change that.","5G6gKGKiphs","sa915611"
