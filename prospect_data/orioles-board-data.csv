"Adley Rutschman","BAL","C","AA",2,1,,"65",2021,"Med","23.3305555","6' 2""","220","S","R",2019,"Draft","BAL",8100000,"Oregon State","Rutschman is the total package, a physical monster who also has superlative baseball acumen and leadership qualities. From his sophomore season onward (and arguably starting in the Fall before that), he went wire-to-wire as the top prospect in his class, a complete player and the best draft prospect in half a decade. His entire profile is ideal. It's rare for ambidextrous swingers to have polished swings from both sides of the plate, and even more so to have two nearly identical, rhythmic swings that produce power. 
It's more atypical still for that type of hitter to be a great defender at a premium position. Rutschman has a pickpocket's sleight of hand and absolutely cons umpires into calling strikes on the edge of the zone, and resolute umpires end up hearing it from biased fans who are easier marks. Aside from two instances, all of my Rutschman pop times over three years of looks are between 1.86 and 1.95 seconds, comfortably plus times on throws often right on the bag. Rutschman has the physical tools to become the best catcher in baseball, provided he stays healthy (he had some shoulder/back stuff in college). He's also an ultra-competitive, attentive, and vocal team leader who shepherds pitchers with measured but intense encouragement. It fires up his teammates and feels like it comes from a real place, rather than something he's forcing. Aside from the questions that arose as teams scrutinized Rutschman's medicals with a magnifying glass before the draft (it was described to me as ""stuff consistent with catching and playing football""), he's a perfect prospect subject only to the risk and attrition that all catchers face. 
Because the 2020 minor league season was cancelled, we have no full-season looks nor data to alter or buttress this foundation, and Adley looked the same as ever in the Fall. I realize readers will have Matt Wieters flashbacks because Rutchsman's frame and switch-hitting, upright stance are dead ringers for Wieters', but this guy's blood courses through his veins at a much different temperature. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>","riXzQCIbfPw","sa3011643"

A physical transformation coincided with a senior spring breakthrough, which was then bettered by cogent repertoire work in pro ball. Rodriguez's changeup, which was an afterthought back in high school, has screwball action and has become very good, very quickly; it's now the main event. He's now tracking to have a four-pitch mix full of above-average pitches: a mid-90s fastball; a lateral, mid-80s slider; a two-plane, upper-70s curveball; and the low-80s change. His delivery isn't great -- there's a little bit of a head whack, and Rodriguez has a tightly-wound lower half -- but he's never been injured and has thrown an acceptable rate of strikes to this point. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>","XVnKhGydp9Y","sa3008130"

Here's the list of lefty big league starters who throw harder than Hall, who averaged 94.9 mph on his fastball in 2019: Jesús Luzardo, Blake Snell. That's it. 
Because Hall's release is inconsistent, not only did his walk rate regress in 2019, but the quality of his secondary stuff was also less consistent than it was during his very dominant mid-summer stretch in 2018, when his changeup clearly took a leap. Both of his secondaries are often plus; Hall simply has a higher misfire rate than most big league starters. He's still just 21 and has All-Star upside if he starts locating better, which may not come until after he has a couple big league seasons under his belt. I have him projected as a multi-inning reliever. It's a role I think he'd thrive in immediately, one that can impact the ballclub (Hall's on-mound demeanor fits nicely in leveraged situations), provide him with enough in-game reps to try to hone starter's control, and give him a foundation of innings to make a starter leap if he does. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>

He has a 4.5% career walk rate (it was about 7% in his small big league sample) and it's rare for DH/LF sorts to walk that little and be star-level performers. DH types with OBPs in the .310-.320 range typically max out in the 2-3 WAR range, which is where I expect Mountcastle to peak. But his contact quality is quite good, and the visual evaluation of the hit tool and the on-paper performance have been strong for several years, so the degree of confidence that Mountcastle will hit is relatively high for a prospect with plate discipline issues. There are Nick Castellanos similarities in Mountcastle's profile, frame, and swing aesthetic, and Castellanos was a back loaded 50. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>","Mf-E2t1dIxo","18373"

He's kept his big, 6-foot-3 frame lean and speedy during that time, relevant for the corner-only prospect because Kjerstad puts a lot of balls in play down both baselines and runs well enough to turn them all into extra bases. He can drop the bat head and lift balls at his knees, and also get on top of pitches at the top of the zone. It's plus bat control on a somewhat odd-looking swing. If there are concerns about Kjerstad's cut, I'm not hearing them, as they've been drowned out by how well he's performed. I considered him part of a deep 50 FV tier in the lead up to draft day and the Orioles were able to cut a below-slot deal with him since he didn't have any likely suitors until closer to the back of the top 10. He was absent from the alternate site and instructs due to an extended bout of myocarditis, a heart condition that's often a side effect of viral infection (though Kjerstad isn't known to have tested positive for COVID-19), and can impact long-term heart health. <em>(At-home dev, injury)</em>","m8q8iZiuC60","sa3014439"

Henderson can drop the bat head to impact pitches down and in, or he can flatten it out to barrel pitches up and away from him, and he often laces the latter to left field. He does all of this with quiet control of his swing; he's not selling out to generate the power or swinging conservatively just to make a ton of contact. Henderson raked as a high schooler, both against varsity pitching in the southeast and on the showcase circuit, and was advanced enough that he could have moved more quickly than most other 2019 high school draftees, but 2020 didn't allow for that. Though he played shortstop during his initial pro trial, Henderson has a very tall (but narrow-shouldered) frame and is very likely to kick over to third base, and there's even a chance he outgrows it, though I don't think that will be until much later in his career.

He may need a swing tweak so his barrel better mirrors the flight path of the baseball (if not, we might be looking at more raw power than in-game output), but he has the hand-eye/power combo to profile as an everyday middle infielder, more cleanly at second base because of his modest arm strength. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3014499"

His little mid-80s cutter/slider is command-dependent, but I think he'll have above-average command. Yes, he had walk issues over a small 2020 big league sample, which were largely due to a single, meltdown outing. Remember that Kremer threw 60% of his fastballs in the strike zone in 2019, and I think his issues last year were just small sample noise.

His 2020 was cut short by injury (other alt site pitchers typically threw 500 to 600 pitches there, while Baumann only threw close to 200). Not long after a horrendous late-August outing during which Baumann struggled to find the strike zone, he was shut down with a flexor strain. Because his arm action is so long, both command consistency and injury risk might be ever present here, at least as far as outsider perception is concerned. There's No. 4/5 starter stuff, though. While compromised, Baumann was still up to 95 at the alt site (he sat 92-95 and was touching 97 in 2019). His heater's angle and carry are its headlining attributes, as he generates plus-plus vertical movement that will miss bats at the letters. The rest of the repertoire is only okay, but it's deep, and part of what I think is a viable north/south style of pitching. Baumann's upper-80s slider is terse and cuttery, the type of pitch that induces weak contact rather than whiffs, while his more shapely curveball at times has some arm-side action that is helpful against lefties. He has enough changeup feel to mix that pitch in once in a while; it's more likely to get groundballs than whiffs. If healthy, he'll likely debut in 2021. <em>(Alternate site)</em>",,"sa829681"

He can be beaten at the letters and by back foot breaking balls, but otherwise is capable of doing damage all over the zone. I liked him as a sandwich/early second round prospect and he ended up falling all the way to the top of round three. That prompted a reevaluation, as did Stowers' rough post-draft summer, but ultimately there's rare ability to rotate here and a chance for big, in-game power production, enough to at least be the larger half of a corner platoon in the Seth Smith/Matt Joyce mold if not as a regular. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em>","YIIkMwSpAIw","sa1115829"

You'd think an extreme strike-thrower like this would have the most vanilla, stock footage delivery, but Stallings' is actually kind of funky, and helps his stuff (which <em>is</em> very vanilla) play up a little bit.

Urías has a .270/.360/.420 career line in the minors -- after two DSL seasons with Texas, his rights were loaned and then sold outright to Diablos Rojos in Mexico City, where he hit .318/.402/.467 over five seasons before the Cardinals came calling in the spring of 2018 -- and he's hit well for two consecutive years at Double and Triple-A. His TrackMan data was strong in 2019 (91 mph average exit velo, 47% of balls in play at 95 mph or more), and I think he'd be an interesting, small-trade depth target for a contender. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>"," ","18795"

You'll occasionally see a slower curveball from Zimmermann but he barely threw that pitch during his 2020 big league debut and I'm not sure whether it will come back in 2021 and beyond.

I'll also add that Rom is going to make it a huge pain in the ass for FanGraphs writers to tag Rockies catcher Drew Romo in our pieces: After a 2018 post-draft velocity dip, Rom's heater returned to the upper-80s in 2019 and missed a lot full-season bats, many more than fastballs like his typically do. It has a well above-average spin rate for its velocity and nearly perfect backspin. An equally important part of Rom's success to this point -- 150 strikeouts, 39 walks in 126 innings -- has been his breaking ball command. He can vary shape and locate to his glove side, and Rom has a crude splitter with late dive that has a shot to miss bats. If he can add velo he's going to really blow up, and he's only 21. Velo gains aren't a given though, and Rom has a mesomorphic build, not the sort that has a ton of room for mass.

Like a lot of power pitchers, his fastball plays best at the letters. Bradish's issue is that he struggles to locate up there consistently, and when his fastball is toward the middle of the zone, it's very hittable. Even though he had a velo spike at the alternate site (he averaged 93 and was up to 97 after averaging 91 and touching 95 in 2019), Bradish's fastball swinging strike rate was still pretty average. It makes it more likely that Bradish ends up in a relief role where he mixes in his three other offerings pretty heavily. His mid-80s slider is the pitch opposing hitters seem to struggle most to identify out of his hand and Bradish can throw it for strikes, while his curveball is the pitch he's more comfortable burying in the dirt. He also has an upper-80s changeup with some arm-side action. It's a fourth starter's stuff with a reliever's control, control Bradish and the Orioles will try to develop in 2021 ahead of a likely 40-man roster add.

When he can work it glove side, it has enough break and angle to be a finishing pitch, too. Fastballs like Smith's tend to pair nicely with a changeup but while Smith has fair feel for locating his cambio, it lacks any kind of impact movement.

Hanifee was still available the next time Baltimore was on the clock and he signed for $500,000.

His appeal for the past two years had been his present arm strength and a lean, broad-shouldered, 6-foot-5 frame that foreshadowed more. That hasn't happened, even as Hanifee's gotten stronger-looking. 
His delivery is odd. After his hands break, Hanifee holds the ball out and up above his head like a waiter carrying a tray, then his stride and arm stroke are both very short.
