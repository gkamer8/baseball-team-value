He struck out a lot (again) during the 2018 stretch run, when St. Louis pushed him to Low-A Peoria because he wasn't being challenged in Johnson City. Sent back to Peoria for the first half of 2019, Gorman adjusted to full-season pitching and roasted the Midwest League to the tune of a .241/.344/.448 line, cutting his strikeout rate by eight percentage points. He was promoted to the Florida State League for the second half, and while his walk rate halved and his strikeout rate crept above 30% again, Gorman still managed to post an above-average line for that league as a 19-year-old. The strikeout issues will only become a real concern once Gorman stops showing an ability to adjust over a long period of time. 
His huge power, derived from his imposing physicality and explosive hand speed, is likely to play in games because of the lift in Gorman's swing and his feel for impacting the ball in the air. Because we're talking about a teenager of considerable size, there's a chance Gorman has to move off of third base at some point, but for now we're cautiously optimistic about him staying there for the early part of his big league tenure. There are apt body comps to be made to either of the Seager brothers, while the offensive profile looks more like Miguel San√≥'s.","_2qk0vq7IEA","sa3007017"
"Dylan Carlson","STL","LF",,40,2,,"55",2020,,"21.725","6' 3""","210","S","L",2016,"Draft","STL",1350000,"Elk Grove HS (CA)","A year ago, on the Cardinals list and in our Picks to Click article, we tabbed Carlson as one of the prospects in this org likely to break out. But even we didn't expect he'd nearly go 20/20 and slug .518 at Double-A Springfield. Judging by the fervor this performance created among our more fantasy-focused readers, they may be wondering why we were ahead of the curve a year ago, but aren't hitting the gas on Carlson's evaluation now after the year he had. We certainly like him -- Carlson is balanced and coordinated while hitting from both sides of the plate, his left-handed swing has gorgeous lift and finish, he has advanced bat control for a switch-hitter this age, he's athletic and moves well for his size, and he has high-end makeup. But we have some questions about the ultimate ceiling. 
Carlson is an average runner and a large dude for a 20-year-old. His instincts in center field are okay, but not good enough to overcome long speed that typically falls short at the position. Because of where we have his arm strength graded, we think he fits in left field or at first base. The TrackMan data we sourced also indicates that his 2019 line is a bit of a caricature. His average exit velo (about 88 mph) and rate of balls in play at 95 mph or higher (about 34%) are both right around the big league average, rather than exceptional. The in-office types we talk to about this kind of thing are in love with Carlson because he's only 20, and they anticipate these things will improve, but visual evaluation of his build don't suggest as much physical projection as is typical of someone this young, because he's already a big guy. As a result, he was on the 50/55 FV line for us during the process of compiling this list. The league-average offensive production in left field has been lower than you might expect (it's 100 wRC+ over the last five years) and Carlson might also be able to play a situational center field when the Cards are behind and need offense, as well as some first base. That versatility is valuable, so he tipped into the 55 FV range. But we think he's closer to the line than one might conclude if they were just looking at his surface stats.","5Qo_OiBtqnA","sa917940"

Because Liberatore's fastball has sinker movement, the growth of his changeup is going to be the most important aspect of his development, since those two pitches have similar movement, and will theoretically tunnel better. The results produced by his knockout curveball, which has all-world depth, may suffer because he doesn't have an up-in-the-zone four-seamer to pair with it, but should Liberatore decide to get ahead of hitters by dumping that curveball into the zone, good luck to them. It's the type of pitch that's hard to hit even if you know it's coming, but might be easy to lay off of, in the dirt, because its Loch Ness Monster hump is easy to identify out of the hand. All of the advanced pitchability stuff -- Libby started learning a slider during his senior year of high school, he varies his timing home, and he's likely to pitch backwards with the breaking balls -- is here, too, and that'll be important given the lack of a bat-missing fastball. The total package should result in an above-average big league starter.","IayXSFEwcVU","sa3008163"

It was surprising considering Herrera is physically quite modest, and looked sluggish at times during the Fall league, but by that point he had played in three times as many games as he had the year before, and was likely exhausted. Regular season Herrera was a little leaner, twitchy, and athletic, and was an advanced defender with a mature approach at the plate. He also hit .286/.381/.423 as a 19-year-old catcher in the Midwest League. This guy checks all the proverbial boxes and looks like a well-rounded everyday catching prospect.","Dj8kYAesv6M","sa3003191"

He was used pretty conservatively in a bullpen role after he signed for workload/health reasons, but expect the Cardinals to push him to the upper levels next year, as they often do with recently-drafted college arms. 
The headline pitch here is the curveball, a deadly, mid-70s parabola much like Liberatore's. Like Libby, Thompson's fastball traits don't fit perfectly with it and it probably won't matter very much. The changeup is already quite good, a likely second out-pitch. Thompson gets down the mound well, his arm action is loose (though it comes through a little late), and he has east/west command of all his stuff. He's a concerning injury risk, but has top 100 stuff.",,"sa3011128"

His .276/.357/.463 line was only good enough for a 99 wRC+, the lowest of his career. Long a contact-oriented doubles hitter with a very compact stroke, Knizner is perhaps not the sort of hitter who would have greatly benefitted from a bouncier ball. He's still a much better hitter than most big league catchers, but he's a bad receiver. For the last two years, we were hopeful Knizner would become a passable defender, if later than most, because he only started catching in his early 20s, but it still hasn't happened. He and Yadier Molina are the only two catchers currently on the Cardinals' 40-man, so it looks like he's slated for some kind of timeshare, at least for his rookie season, the last of Yadi's contract. 
His value may be impacted by the implementation of robot umps, which would make Knizner poor receiving moot, but would also put more pressure on him to hit for some power since suddenly every gloveless backstop who can hit will suddenly be viable back there. Knizner's bat-to-ball skills should make him a second-division regular in that scenario.","_tdoPT13xtw","19514"

He has premium lefty velocity, and two usable secondaries. In a vacuum, we prefer Cabrera's changeup to his breaking ball, but his delivery is violent and deceptive, featuring a huge hook in the back (the flexibility in Cabrera's upper back is incredible) and a huge stride home before the ball suddenly appears from a high three-quarters slot.","sKhWIR1ZYYA","17490"

A high school shortstop, Thomas got a $750,000 bonus to sign with Toronto as a fifth rounder in 2014. He played some second and third base and outfield for the Jays before moving off the dirt entirely in 2017, and he's quickly become a very good center field defender. He couldn't quite repeat that 2018 burst -- a .264/.333/.489 line between Double and Triple-A, including more home runs (27) than in his previous four seasons combined -- in a 2019 shortened by a fractured wrist, but Thomas has good plate coverage that enables a pull-heavy approach, has mostly doubles power, and is fairly selective, and because he's such a good center field defender, we think he's a second-division regular there.","qMOaTp9R6lk","16939"

Torres bounced back in a huge way, and hit .286/.391/.527 in the Tennessee humidity. 
This is a traditional, corner outfield projection prospect. Torres is an immense teenager built much like Franmil Reyes was at the same age. Torres has a chance to grow into similar power as he fills out, though hopefully he stays a little more agile than Reyes and is able to play better outfield defense. Some of the swing elements (how long the barrel is in the zone, the stride length) may need to change to max out the game power, but there's middle-of-the-order thump here.","3I-QOd9oNcA","sa3003233"

He played at East Coast Pro, a major summer showcase, as an older-for-the-class member of the 2020 class, playing against 2019 prospects. He played well and reclassified to the 2019 class in March of that year after switching high schools. Clubs weren't prepared and hadn't scouted Fletcher intensely, with only a few months of rain-filled Maine high school games versus weak competition to make what was potentially a seven figure decision.  Between having Scott Boras as his agent, a strong commitment to Vanderbilt, and the off-field drama surrounding his eligibility, some teams punted on Fletcher because they couldn't get enough info to be comfortable by draft day. 
The Cardinals were not one of those teams, but both they and more casually-engaged clubs saw flashes of plus raw power, speed, and arm strength. St. Louis popped him in the second round for an overslot $1.5 million deal and pushed him  to the Appy League after nine good GCL games to get him under the lights and in a more professional game atmosphere, where Fletcher struggled a bit.

The changeup doesn't even need to be located toward the bottom of the zone to be effective since hitters, who are geared up for the heater, are so flummoxed by its speed and movement.

His approach, however, is a problem. During some of his Fall League starts, Montero saw five pitches over the course of an entire game. During the regular season, he averaged just shy of 2.5 pitches per plate appearance. For comparison's sake, among big league hitters with at least 200 PAs in 2019, Willians Astudillo ranked last in pitchers per PA with 2.9; no other big leaguer was under three.

He had the second-highest average exit velo in this system and the lowest average launch angle, and this with a swing that's better than it was two years ago. He has a shot to break out if there's a relevant swing change; if not, a bench role is going to be tough to grab hold of because of the lack of other skills.","qBdkDD7U1B4","15490"

It's not abundantly clear whether Rodriguez will be able to catch as, at age 18, he's already a pretty big, long-levered kid who was initially unsure if he even wanted to try it. But Rodriguez can really hit. He has excellent timing, bat control, and feel for all-fields contact, and he can open up and get his barrel on pitches inside. He might end up at first base or in an outfield corner, but he might hit enough to profile at those spots, and if he can catch, his ceiling is sizable.",,"sa3005532"

The chances of that seem low considering how badly Avelino has struggled with it to this point, but his stuff is just too good to stick him in the honorable mention section.",,"sa3003040"
