He's also athletic and moves well for his size. I still have some questions about his ultimate upside because I think he's much more likely to end up in left field than in center. His instincts in center are okay, but I don't think he has the long speed that is typical at the position. His 2019 minor league TrackMan data indicates his statline from that year was a bit of a caricature, but his Savant page indicates the opposite with regard to his 2020 debut struggles. I wonder if pro models have been overrating Carlson due to his age because even though he's only the age of a college bat, he doesn't have the physical projection you'd expect of a hitter that age. Of course, it's not like Juan Soto still has physical projection, either. The league-average offensive production in left field has been lower than you might expect (good for a 100 wRC+ over the last five years) and Carlson might also be able to play a situational center when the Cards are behind and need offense, as well as some first base. That versatility is valuable icing on a switch-hitting cake. Carlson projects as a well-rounded switch-hitter with excellent feel for the strike zone. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>","5Qo_OiBtqnA","20126"

He struck out a lot (again) during the 2018 stretch run, when St. Louis pushed him to Low-A Peoria because he wasn't being challenged in Johnson City. Sent back to Peoria for the first half of 2019, Gorman adjusted to full-season pitching and roasted the Midwest League to the tune of a .241/.344/.448 line, cutting his strikeout rate by eight percentage points. He was promoted to the Florida State League for the second half, and while his walk rate halved and his strikeout rate crept above 30% again, Gorman still managed to post an above-average line for that league as a 19-year-old. His strikeout issues will only become a real concern for me once Gorman stops showing an ability to adjust over a long period of time. 
His huge power, derived from his imposing physicality and explosive hand speed, is likely to play in games because of the lift in Gorman's swing and his feel for impacting the ball in the air. Because we're talking about a teenager of considerable size, there's a chance he has to move off of third base at some point, and now that Nolan Arenado is in town, St. Louis will see how Gorman looks at second and in left field. I bet he'll be able to make routine plays on balls hit to him at the keystone, but I have no idea what he'll look like operating around the bag. There are apt body comps to be made to either of the Seager brothers, while the offensive profile looks more like Miguel Sanó's. <em>(Alternate site)</em>","_2qk0vq7IEA","sa3007017"

It was surprising considering that Herrera is physically quite modest, and looked sluggish at times during that year's Fall League, but by that point he had played in three times as many games as he had the year before, and was likely exhausted. Regular season Herrera was a little leaner, twitchy, and athletic, and was an advanced defender with a mature approach at the plate. He also hit .286/.381/.423 as a 19-year-old catcher in the Midwest League.

Because Liberatore's fastball has sinker movement, the growth of his changeup is going to be the most important aspect of his development, since those two pitches have similar movement and will theoretically tunnel better. That pitch has indeed improved and will likely be his putaway offering in the big leagues. 
That may surprise readers aware of his curveball's reputation. Indeed, Liberatore's curveball has all-world depth, but I think its results may suffer because he doesn't have an up-in-the-zone four-seamer to pair with it. Instead it's the sort of pitch I think he'll use to get ahead of hitters late in outings, dumping that curveball into the zone for strike one. It's the type of pitch that's hard to hit even if you know it's coming, but might be easy to lay off of when Libby tries to bury it in the dirt, because its Loch Ness Monster hump is easy to identify out of the hand. All of the advanced pitchability stuff -- Libby started learning a slider during his senior year of high school, he varies his timing home, and he's likely to pitch backwards with his breaking balls -- is here, too, and that'll be important given the lack of a bat-missing fastball. The slider isn't there quite yet but, based on Liberatore's natural ability to spin the ball, I bet it will be eventually. He profiles as an innings-eating, 2-ish WAR starter. <em>(Alternate site)</em>","IayXSFEwcVU","sa3008163"

He looked like a potential top 10 pick, then came out of the gate slow the following spring and never really had a chance to totally course correct because of the pandemic. Walker pitched and played shortstop during his pre-draft summer, and had among the best present raw power and pretty clearly the best raw power projection of any of the 2020 high schoolers because of his huge frame. With that frame came a perceived likelihood that he would eventually end up at third base and the possibility that he might need to move all the way over to first. Those seeming eventualities remain, but Walker also has really rare measureable power for someone his age and he's a remarkable athlete for how big he is. Physically, he might end up in Joey Gallo territory at maturity. The Cardinals sent him to the alt site after the draft and Walker began to separate himself from the other high-variance teenagers in the org there.

He was used pretty conservatively in a bullpen role after he signed for workload/health reasons, then spent 2020 at the alt site rather than race to the upper levels like most Cardinals college draftees tend to. The headline pitch here is the curveball, a deadly, mid-70s parabola much like Liberatore's. Like Libby, Thompson's fastball traits don't fit perfectly with it, which limits his curveball utility, but it's a great in-zone offering he can use to get ahead of hitters. His velocity actually ticked down throughout 2021 spring training -- he was 90-94 early, then 88-92 late -- but a source told me he was back up to 95 the week before this list published. There's a new-ish cutter/slider here, too, and it's interesting that even though Thompson has elite curveball spin rates, that hasn't translated to the spin on the cutter/slider at all; that pitch's rates were close to 2,000 rpm during the spring. It looks below-average to the eye. He threw few if any changeups this spring. So health and pro development hasn't enabled Thompson to make a rapid, instant leap in stuff quality. Rather than a No. 4/5 starter foundation with a chance to really pop, he looks more like a low-variance No. 4/5 guy. <em>(Alternate Site)</em>",,"sa3011128"

From a pure athleticism standpoint, I think he has a chance, though whether his diminutive frame can withstand the physical toll that would come with it is harder to say. Winn is an elite on-mound athlete and also has plus-plus bat speed, rotating with explosion on par with lots of Top 100 prospects. His straight line speed and arm strength make him a developmental fit at shortstop and if he can tone down some of the noise in his swing without compromising its explosiveness, he could end up hitting for power, too. The potential for power and viable defense at short would give him a pretty low contact bar to clear; he could only develop a 40 bat and still be a slam dunk everyday player. 
He didn't pitch the summer before his draft year and has a pretty violent head whack, so there's relief risk on the pitching side of the ledger here. But Winn will bump 98 and has an absolute hammer breaking ball, as well as the arm speed to occasionally sell a good changeup. It makes sense to develop Winn as both a hitter and pitcher for a while if only to make sure the position you pick is the correct one. He's going to be on an innings limit during his first year or two of pro ball, so there's little cost to his development to do so. He's one of the more exciting and fascinating prospects in all the minors. <em>(Alternate site)</em>",,"sa3014506"

A hulking 6-foot-6, Oviedo has a workhorse starter's build that comps to a young Josh Beckett, he throws really hard, and he flashes above-average breaking stuff. All of these components are present intermittently, but Oviedo just hasn't leveled up as a strike-thrower yet, and his slider and curveball aren't nasty enough to override his loose command; they need to be located. The same is true of Oviedo's fastball. Even though it's in the mid-90s and has something close to a backspinning axis, his size creates more downhill plane on the pitch than a fastball with these other traits wants to have. I'm pretty confident Oviedo's going to be an integral part of a pitching staff eventually. At 23, it's looking more like that will be in relief further down the line, though right now it makes more sense to have him stretched out as starter depth. His repertoire depth and starter pedigree make him a strong candidate to work in a four-to-six out role. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>"," ","22487"

This is a traditional corner outfield projection prospect. Torres is an immense teenager built much like Franmil Reyes was at the same age. Torres has a chance to grow into similar power as he fills out, though hopefully he stays a little more agile than Reyes has and is able to play better outfield defense. Some of the swing elements (how long the barrel is in the zone, the stride length) may need to change to max out the game power, but there's middle-of-the-order thump here. <em>(At-home dev)</em>","3I-QOd9oNcA","sa3003233"

Because Baker is the size of one of the Easter Island Moai statues, there's some fear about his athletic longevity. But he has monstrous raw power and has performed when healthy (I'm not sweating a .390 SLG in the Florida State League), so he has a fair chance to hit at least enough to be a CJ Cron/Jesús Aguilar sort of performer.

He played at East Coast Pro, a major summer showcase, as an older-than-his-peers member of the 2020 class, but against 2019 prospects a grade above him (though about his age). He played well there and decided to reclassify to the 2019 graduate/draft class in March of that same year; Fletcher also switched high schools. Clubs weren't prepared and hadn't scouted Fletcher the summer before with the same intensity they would have had they known he'd be eligible the next year. They had only a few months of rain-filled Maine high school games versus weak competition to make what was potentially a seven-figure decision. Between having Scott Boras as his agent, a strong commitment to Vanderbilt, and the off-field drama surrounding his eligibility, some teams punted on Fletcher because they couldn't get enough info to be comfortable by draft day. 
The Cardinals were not one of those teams, but both they and more casually-engaged clubs saw flashes of plus raw power, speed, and arm strength from Fletcher before the draft. St. Louis popped him in the second round for an overslot $1.5 million deal and pushed him to the Appy League after nine good GCL games to get him under the lights and in a more professional game atmosphere, where Fletcher struggled a bit. Then Fletcher spent 2020 sequestered at the alt site. Reports coming out of there weren't very good, but it's unsurprising that a guy who was at a high school in Maine struggled with what amounts to Triple-A pitching. There's some early-career smoke surrounding Fletcher's ability to lay off breaking balls but let's see how he does against run-of-the-mill full-season ball before declaring him any more of a hit tool risk than he already was. <em>(Alternate site)</em>",,"sa3010709"

Even though he wasn't throwing as hard, Bedell struck out 35 and walked just four in 24 innings of work (he did give up five tanks, though). That's because Bedell executes his pitch locations so consistently, especially his curveball, which has above-average depth and plays like a plus pitch because of his command. 
The delivery here is a little scary. Bedell's delivery is stiff-looking, he's a 4 athlete, and he has a long, violent arm swing. He might benefit from a more open stride home (something more like what Michael Wacha used to look like so he's not throwing across his body so much), which might help him create more vertical action on his fastball at the same time. This spring, Bedell came to camp with his old, harder fastball and was sitting 90-94 tuning up for minor league spring training in Florida.

But Williams still has enough offensive utility to play a corner platoon role. John Nogowski arguably outhit him during the spring (in my opinion, Williams' at-bat quality was better than his raw numbers indicate) but Williams is the better roster fit with the other big league Cardinals due to his handedness.

Romeri was so below the radar on that team that many scouts didn't have him turned in despite watching him numerous times on what was likely the most-scouted high school team in the country. In fairness, the seven-hole hitter on a high school team is not usually where you find a prospect; he wasn't on our pre-draft rankings either. Romeri is a solidly average runner and thrower who profiles in right field, and his exit velos and OPS both stood out in his pro debut in the GCL. There's a faint chance for a low-end regular but he'll more likely profile as a part-time player. <em>(At-home dev)</em>",,"sa3010723"

After coasting through the lower levels of the minors, Cruz's walk rate started to climb into red flag territory as he approached the big leagues, though in 2019 he still struck out well over a batter-per-inning at Double- and Triple-A. That year he sat 94-96 and touched 98. His arm strength was way down during his 2020 debut, when Cruz topped out at 93. In the spring of 2021, Cruz was more 93-94 and touched 96. He has a pretty typical fastball/slider middle relief combo and is a softer-bodied guy with below-average athleticism and feel to pitch.

He's now a sinkerball reliever (63% groundball rate) whose heater has been comfortably in the mid-90s for the last couple of seasons, including during the spring of 2021 when Jones was peaking at 97. His lack of fastball command is a little bit more of a problem than it would be for most relievers because Jones' flavor of fastball has less margin for error in the strike zone. Look for him to try to work back into counts with his slider for this reason, too. He projects in up/down relief. <em>(Alternate site)</em> ","PQOEcwWo-Xc","sa738697"

He has the repertoire depth for a long relief role, but his fastball has cut action rather than ride/carry, so it accidentally runs into barrels. That might be problematic, but based on arm strength and the pitch mix, he's pretty clearly a lower-leverage long relief type. He'll mostly work in the 92-94 range with a mid-80s slider and a splitter that I thought was plus during Fall League.

But Rodriguez can really hit. He has excellent timing, bat control, and feel for all-fields contact, and he can open up and get his barrel on pitches inside.
