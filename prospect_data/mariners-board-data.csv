One of these shared logins is for a DAZN account I procured in order to enjoy the platform's boxing archive, only to discover it had several classic MLB games as well. Among these is footage of Miguel Cabrera's big league debut, which I put on one fall night as I prepared to cut up Fall League video of Julio Rodriguez taken earlier in the day. As I split my attention between a fresh-faced Miggy and a young Julio, I noticed a rare similarity: front foot variation. Some hitters are capable of altering their stride direction based on pitch location, perhaps best exemplified by a famous GIF of Cabrera hitting home runs on pitches in six very different parts of the strike zone. In that GIF you can faintly make out how Cabrera's footwork varies on several of those swings, and though he doesn't do it consistently yet, Julio shows glimpses of this same seemingly innate aptitude, especially his ability to open up, clear his hips, and wreck pitches on the inner half. 
He can be fooled by sweeping breaking balls that make him want to open up and pull the ball, and heâ€™ll swing at inside sliders that finish away from him, but other than those consistent issues, Rodriguez is a very mature hitter, with a mature personality and body to match. He excelled despite Seattle's very aggressive full-season assignment, a move I was skeptical of, and had an impressive Fall League as an 18-year-old. He's already a 40 runner (I had him timed in the 4.4s throughout Fall League), which means he is ticketed for right field rather than center, but the bat is real. I have plus hit and power projection here and I know scouts who have a 70 on the bat, though his approach and the way his head was flying out during some of his AFL at-bats stopped me from going that heavy with my hit tool grade. I think he's going to come up quickly and be an All-Star outfielder and the affable face of the franchise.","fm1zz74sRbc","sa3005720"
"Jarred Kelenic","SEA","CF",,11,2,,"60",2021,,"20.9944444","6' 1""","196","L","L",2018,"Draft","NYM",4500000,"Waukesha West HS (WI)","It was an injury-laden year for Kelenic (a wrist and ankle during the summer), who was supposed to pick up Fall League reps until those was delayed by wisdom tooth extraction and then ultimately squashed by back tightness. Despite that, and especially in spite of the wrist injury, the beefcake Wisconsinite hit .291/.364/.540 with 23 dingers and 20 steals across three levels, and reached Double-A as a young 20-year-old. Kelenic is absolutely jacked but it hasn't detracted from his twitch, nor has his size borrowed from his range in center field, which is suitable if unspectacular for the position. 
The carrying tool here is the bat, which has been the case since Kelenic was 15. Like most elite prospects he's been one of the -- if not <em>the</em> -- best hitters his age from the time scouts began to see him, and Kelenic hit elite prep pitching all throughout high school. He is short to the ball with power, and can just turn his hands over and catch heaters up, in, or both, which bodes well for him against a pitching population that is working up there with increasing frequency. The .540 SLG% from 2019 is a bit above what's realistic going forward, largely because there's just no more room for mass on the body. As is the case with most hitters evaluated in this stratosphere, reports of Kelenic's competitiveness and work ethic are strong, and have been since he was in high school. In fact, one scout on the amateur side thought he was too intense at times, sort of in the Jimmy Butler realm of teammate interaction, but I haven't heard anything like that lately. He's much more stick than glove, but Kelenic looks like an All-Star center fielder who's rapidly approaching Seattle.","LFdX2RZaB64","sa3007741"
"Logan Gilbert","SEA","RHP",,46,3,,"55",2021,,"23.1916666","6' 5""","195","R","R",2018,"Draft","SEA",,"Stetson","Last year I wrote about the possibility that Gilbert would experience a velo rebound in pro ball because I thought he had been overtaxed at Stetson. He was sitting 92-96 as a rising sophomore on the Cape, but often sat 90-94, and sometimes 88-91, throughout his starts the following spring. Last year he was again up to 96 but sat 91-94, about the halfway mark between his peak and nadir as an amateur. Considering how readily pitchers lose velo in pro ball, that's still a win for Seattle. While all of Gilbert's secondary pitches are average and flash above, I think his command will enable them to play above their raw grades, which, combined with what the innings count could be because of his frame and how efficiently he works, will still make him an above-average WAR generating starter.","l0Jw6egZzJg","sa3008598"

All of the window dressing -- plus-plus first base defense, plus speed, a backwards hit/throw profile -- was nice but ultimately, some teams saw a first baseman without sufficient power. After they drafted him, the Mariners made subtle changes to his lower half, drawing his front knee back toward his rear hip more than he did at Kentucky, and taking a longer stride back toward the pitcher. White is more often finishing with a flexed front leg now, which has helped him go down and lift balls in the bottom part of the strike zone by adjusting his lower half instead of his hands. The power output improved and is supported by the measurable underlying data. Now that he's signed a pre-debut deal, it's very likely that White breaks camp with the big club, and he projects as a solid everyday first baseman.","0lWaqOjEvP0","sa915774"

He sits in the mid-90s and will flash a plus changeup and slider, both of which live in the 82-85mph range. He has the prototypical power pitcher's build, delivery, and stuff, he throws strikes and had a 30-to-2 strikeout to walk ratio in his final three starts of 2020 after that rough opener.

That's a 4% walk rate, and in Kirby's most recent calendar year of innings, it has been a microscopic 1.3%. While his pre-draft velocity was strong (touching 97, often 93-95 early, 91-94 late in starts), his secondary stuff was very average. His slider and curveball (the latter is better) ran together a bit, and his changeup had inconsistent finish. But often, elite command of what is a 55-grade pitch in a vacuum leads to elite results (see: Bieber, Shane), and I think that sort of secondary pitch effectiveness is possible for Kirby. 
One of Seattle's stated post-draft goals for the right-hander was to make him stronger. In 2020 spring bullpens, Kirby looked noticeably thicker and stronger, and he is indeed throwing harder, touching 99 mph several times in Peoria side sessions. Logan Gilbert threw very hard in a similar setting the year before, and though his in-season velo band was beneath his pre-season bullpens, he was still above the prior year's range. The difference is the obvious change in Kirby's body. I expect something similar to Gilbert's trajectory here (and for Juan Then, who appears later on this list and was also throwing much harder in the spring before baseball shut down). Even with fairly vanilla secondary stuff, mid-90s heat and Kirby's potential for elite command gives him a mid-rotation ceiling.",,"sa3011526"
"Noelvi Marte","SEA","SS",,,7,,"45+",2023,,"18.7444444","6' 1""","180","R","R",2018,"J2","SEA",1550000,"Dominican Republic","When it comes to both the broad, back-of-the-house view of his amateur profile and his promotion/big league time horizon, Marte's career has mimicked Julio Rodriguez's so far. He was a bigger, more physical signee than is typical for the international market, the sort most teams would not hesitate to debut in domestic rookie ball. And like Rodriguez, the Mariners allowed Marte to spend his first pro summer dominating competition that simply didn't challenge him (the average DSL fastball velo last year was 88 mph), which led to a .309/.371/.511 line. Marte had a chance to earn an aggressive assignment with a great 2020 spring (probably not Low-A, but perhaps a summer Northwest League placement), putting him on a relative fast track for a teenage hitter, though like the rest of baseball, that possibility in now on hold. 
From an individual tools and skills perspective, Marte's peers are elite high school players. As an amateur, there was uncertainty surrounding his hands, actions, and general ability to stay on the infield, but pro looks have been more favorable, backed by enough arm strength to hide potential future range deficiencies. My previous research into shortstop size has shown that most teenage prospects gain about 30 pounds between when they're 18 and 21 years old, which puts Marte's baseline body projection in the Willy Adames/Trevor Story realm, or about 210 pounds. So long as his hands have indeed improved, that's a pretty favorable comp for his body/range-based fit at short. It means there's Goldilocks Zone power/defensive spectrum potential here, as Marte already has 50-grade raw power at age 18 and will probably have at least a full grade more at maturity. His TrackMan power metrics (they're over on The Board) are in the 40/45 range right now because Marte's swing elements are not always well-timed. They are, however, very athletic. The big leg kick (which Marte is balanced enough to utilize), the little bit of bat wrap to create some loop and lift, and the ability to move the barrel around the zone are all encouraging swing elements, but we really don't know a lot about Marte's bat-to-ball skills right now because he just hasn't faced good pitching yet. There's clearly huge ceiling here and I have Marte in the same FV tier Zac Veen, my highest-ranked prep amateur right now.","24XWJlBKDh0","sa3008745"
"Justus Sheffield","SEA","LHP","MLB",,8,,"45",2020,,"24.1694444","5' 10""","195","L","L",2014,"Draft","CLE",1600000,"Tullahoma HS (TN)","The roller coaster prospectdom of Justus Sheffield may finally be reaching its terminus. Several repertoire changes, two trades (and the scrutiny that comes with that), fluctuations in his walk rate, some injuries (most notably shoulder stiffness in 2018), and mixed performance at the upper levels have caused a constant need for re-evaluation. The latest of these many developments is a logical shift, given Sheffield's sinker-friendly arm slot, to a two-seam look on the fastball. Sheffield's 2020 spring velo was parked in the 89-93 range, but now his fastball has more tailing/sinking action, which dovetails very nicely with the shape of his slider. Sheffield will throw a shorter, curt slider in the zone for strikes (one scout source who saw Sheff this spring thought it might be a separate cutter) and a longer, nastier, bat-missing version that finishes out of the strike zone. This pitch is plus, and was used heavily in Sheffield's electric spring outings, especially as a back foot out-pitch to righties. 
Sheffield's changeup is also good, but his arm side command of all his pitches is not, so whether he'll be able to consistently set up the change with well-located fastballs is in doubt. So, too, is Sheffield's ability to eat innings like a traditional starter because of his hot and cold strike throwing. Some teams just have him projected in the bullpen because of how erratic the strikes have been historically. He's in the same FV tier as Red Sox righty Bryan Mata, who also has sinker-oriented stuff and significant relief risk.","EHh7N6woil4","17285"
"Kyle Lewis","SEA","RF","MLB",,9,,"45",2020,,"25.0027777","6' 4""","210","R","R",2016,"Draft","SEA",3286700,"Mercer","""He's still a 24-year-old who struck out 29% of the time at Double-A."" This was the general industry response to early drafts I circulated of my Top 100, which had Lewis toward the back of the 50 FV tier where players like Jose Siri and Monte Harrison have been when they've made the list. Lewis and his knee (he tore his ACL in 2016) finally looked healthy last year (his swing had more movement, a bigger leg kick, and he seemed to be twisting and bending it with more comfort), and his underlying power data, which I'll get to shortly, is spectacular. But in some ways what Lewis' health helped reinforce was skepticism regarding his hit tool. There are folks in baseball who think that on a binary level, Lewis will not hit enough to have a meaningful career. I think he'll be a high-variance big leaguer, grinding through some frustrating, 1-WAR seasons while he clubs 30-plus bombs in others, similar to Jorge Soler, Domingo Santana, and countless other tantalizing toolsheds who strike out a lot. 
As for that underlying power data I promised you, Lewis' is very encouraging. If you've been reading this year's lists, you know the Southern League offensive environment was very unkind to hitters last season. A source not with Seattle told me that based on his TrackMan/Statcast data, Lewis' Expected SLG%, was about .100 higher than his actual output, with an xSLG up around .500. He averaged 92 mph off the bat last year and hit 53% of balls in play at 95 mph or above (a 70 on the scale); another source whose team tracked Hard Outs among 2019 minor leaguers (balls in play at 95 mph or up that resulted in outs) told me Lewis made more than 40 of them last year, which was in the top 10 in all the minors. On balance, I think Lewis is a 45, a 1.5 WAR player on average during his years of team control. But he has plus-plus, impact power and could get hot and make some All-Star teams during that span, while other years will be quite lean.","XQKmDL-5xqQ","19508"

Last year, as many orgs have done, Mariners catchers began working on one knee, a move that tends to be favorable for framing but not for throwing, a skill of dwindling importance (for now). Perhaps not coincidentally (or perhaps because we were wrong about Raleigh's arm grade last year, when we 55'ed it), reports on Raleigh's arm strength are worse than they were a year ago, though it appears he's a viable, long-term catcher, if an unspectacular one. If that's true, then Raleigh has a great chance to be an average everyday backstop thanks to his power and a sentient approach that enables him to hit for it in games and reach base at an above-average clip.",,"sa3008377"

Brendan Gawlowski's spring look at Dunn, during which the right-hander sat 92-94 over three innings, is perhaps indicative of the former since Dunn rarely worked with his changeup at a time when most starters are working heavily with their tertiary pitch in preparation for the season. Still, I remain somewhat bullish on Dunn's changeup development. He's had stretches in the past where it's been a plus pitch and it's arguably the best long-term fit with his fastball's tailing/sinking shape. What I'm less optimistic about is Dunn's starter stamina. He looked gassed late last year and while into the mid-90s early, was not throwing as hard in subsequent innings this spring. Ideally his fastball lives in at least the 93-96 mph range out of the bullpen and Dunn can be a dynamic, three-pitch reliever. I have his future fastball grade projected as if that's the outcome.","wO2TJso58R8","19268"

He creates a nearly perfect vertical arm slot by striding wide open, starting on the third base side of the rubber but landing in the middle of the mound. It helps give his fastball plus-plus carry and ride. Delaplane also has a power, Brad Lidge-style slider with late, downward movement. He has less raw arm strength than the Nick Andersons of the world, but the stuff works in the same way, and I think Delaplane will be a reliever of rare quality.",,"sa3004222"

After the draft, in one- and two-inning outings, he sat 92-95 with a plus curveball (and fewer, if any, sliders). I'm skeptical that Williamson can hold 92-95 as a starter for a whole season because of how his stuff has waned in the past. He also suffered a severe hip injury while in junior college (he tore both labrums dunking a basketball and needed surgery) that might impact his ability to do it. I buy that the velo will be there in short stints and that both breaking balls, assuming the slider returns, will be plus. As such, I have Williamson projected as a three-pitch power reliever.","d-9h6aeLO1s","sa3011494"

He had a velocity spike over the offseason and, after sitting 91-95 and topping at 96 last year, was up to 99 mph in the bullpen this spring before baseball ceased operations due to the pandemic. Similar to the way Vanderbilt and Kyle Wright found an extra gear for his fastball before the draft, a lower, more naturally comfortable arm slot for Then is part of what seems to have brought this about. Last year, his well-located sliders were plus and the rest of his repertoire below, but he's lanky and loose, and quite smooth, so that stuff has been at least somewhat projectable. How the lower slot impacts the secondaries and command we won't know until after Then has taken the new delivery for a spin, but even if things go awry, the velo bump everyone's been hoping for has seemingly arrived, so a late-inning reliever outcome is now in play.",,"sa3002793"

He began the year in the Low-A bullpen (50 K, 9 BB in 35 innings), then in June was moved to the rotation and thrived for 12 starts. He made a few late-August starts at Hi-A, and was good there, too. Sweet has fastball command, fastball ride, and a plus changeup. He's a little light on velocity, only sitting 90-93, but he's garnered swings and misses at that velocity at the top of the strike zone so far. His changeup has bat-eluding sink and fade, and is used against righty hitters. The breaking ball is just okay, but he can land it for strikes to start counts. 
It's a 40-man look, to be sure. Perhaps the velo would tick up in the bullpen in an interesting way (all our Sweet info comes from folks who've seen him start), but for now he projects in the fifth or sixth starter area.",,"sa3008340"

Those who saw Benitez as an amateur and hoped he'd enjoy a pro velo bump have been proven correct, as the 20-year-old lefty was sitting 89-92 and up to 94 last year. He has big curveball spin rates but the pitch is pretty easy to identify out of his hand, and he barely throws it.
