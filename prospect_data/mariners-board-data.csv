He got regular big league at-bats during spring training ahead of the shutdown, then had some very high-profile homers during summer camp and at the alternate site, which you probably already know because the Mariners' prospect PR machine is very strong (maybe too strong for the club's own good). I wrote last year that even though Kelenic had become a maxed-out beefcake, it hadn't detracted from his ability to play a fringe center field. More recent looks indicate that is no longer the case. During several spring looks he failed to make plays on balls that I'd expect an average center fielder to make, especially fly balls in the gap that ideally your center fielder runs down. Kelenic's size at his age may eventually push him to the 1B/DH realm, or at least cause him to slow down and be below-average in an outfield corner. 
I don't think it matters. Kelenic rakes. His feel for contact, strength, and mature approach combine to make him a lethal offensive threat. He is short to the ball with power and can rip his top hand through to catch fastballs at the top of the zone, which bodes well for him against a pitching population that is working up there with increasing frequency. His short levers help him get to velocity on the inner half, and his swing path also enables him to get extended and put balls away from him in the opposite field gap. He's been the among the most polished hitters his age since he was 15 and has a track record of statistical success dating back to his underclass high school days -- he's just added upwards of 30 pounds of muscle to that foundation of skill. He's the most stable of the 60 FV prospects and likely to make an immediate impact now that he's on the major league roster. <em>(Alternate site)</em>","LFdX2RZaB64","22558"

His approach and plate coverage in the Dominican were bad, and his swing's front foot variability, which I wrote about last year, was gone. Julio became a bucket strider, striding open like he was trying to pull everything. Some hitters can do this and still manage to really get their arms extended to cover the outer half of the plate (Eddie Rosario, Alex Kirilloff), and Rodríguez absolutely has the strength to do damage the other way if he turns out to be this kind of hitter. But he swung inside of an awful lot of well-located sliders in LIDOM. Not nasty sliders, mind you -- a bunch of fringe big leaguers and indy ball guys pitch in LIDOM -- just well-located ones, something there's no shortage of in the big leagues. He either needs to be in position to dive and spoil some of those, or just do a better job of laying off them entirely. 
A swing change has been made and was evident early during 2021, as Julio's hands are loading further away from him body, which has altered his posture through contact. His torso is hanging over the hitting zone now in a way that looks more like Mike Trout's posture, and I think this will help Julio at least spoil those breaking balls away from him. The calling card power and makeup are still present, and Rodríguez's 35-plus homer, All-Star slugger ceiling remains the same. He also showed up for 2021 spring training having lost a bunch of weight and running a full grade better than he did in 2019 and '20; he's once again an average runner from home to first. His swing-happy 2020 was an indication that adjustments might slow his ascent through the system but he's already begun to make them. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League, LIDOM)</em>","fm1zz74sRbc","sa3005720"

He was sitting 92-96 as a rising sophomore on the Cape, but often sat 90-94, and sometimes 88-91, throughout his starts the following spring. Last year, he was again up to 96 but sat 91-94, about the halfway mark between his peak and nadir as an amateur. Considering how readily pitchers lose velo in pro ball, that's still a win for Seattle. Even though it only sits 93-94, Gilbert's fastball is his best pitch and the way he most effectively whiffs hitters, though maybe his changeup will show some late development. While all of Gilbert's secondary pitches are average and flash above, I think his command will enable them to play above their raw grades, which, combined with what the innings count could be because of his frame and how efficiently he works, will still make him an above-average WAR generating starter. <em>(Alternate site)</em>","l0Jw6egZzJg","22250"

He sits in the mid-90s and will flash a plus changeup and slider. His slider lives in the 83-85 mph range, while the changeup has been harder this year, closer to 87. It looks like he's leaning more on two-seamers so far in 2021. He has the prototypical power pitcher's build, delivery, and stuff, he throws strikes and had a 30-to-2 strikeout-to-walk ratio in his final three starts of 2020 after that rough opener. He's now in the hands of a Mariners dev group that has helped several of their recent high draft picks improve.

For Marte, that means weighing the certainty that he'll have power (because he already does) against the possibility that his size, which is part of what provides that power, will eventually move him off of shortstop. My previous research into shortstop size has shown that most teenage prospects gain about 30 pounds between when they're 18 and 21 years old, which puts Marte's baseline body projection in the Willy Adames/Trevor Story realm, at about 210 pounds, assuming Marte's current listed weight is correct. I'm inclined to think he'll end up north of that just based on how big and imposing his frame has already become before he has even turned 20. If only because of what improved defensive positioning allows, there's Goldilocks Zone power/defensive spectrum potential here, as Marte already has enough raw juice to put balls out to all fields, and will probably have at least a full grade more at maturity. His TrackMan power metrics (they're over on The Board) are in the 40/45 range right now because Marte's swing elements are not always well-timed. They are, however, very athletic. The big leg kick (which Marte is balanced enough to utilize), the little bit of bat wrap to create some loop and lift, and the ability to move the barrel around the zone are all encouraging swing elements, but we really don't know a lot about Marte's bat-to-ball skills right now because he hasn't really been seen or generated a sufficient sample of stats against good pitching yet. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>","24XWJlBKDh0","sa3008745"

That's a 4% walk rate, and in Kirby's most recent calendar year of innings, it has been a microscopic 1.3%. While his pre-draft velocity was strong (touching 97, often 93-95 early, 91-94 late in starts), his secondary stuff was very average. His slider and curveball (the latter is better) ran together a bit, and his changeup had inconsistent finish. But often elite command of what is a 55-grade pitch in a vacuum leads to elite results (see: Bieber, Shane), and I think that sort of secondary pitch effectiveness is possible for Kirby. 
One of Seattle's stated post-draft goals for the right-hander was to make him stronger. In 2020 spring bullpens, Kirby looked noticeably thicker and stronger, and he was indeed throwing harder, touching 99 mph several times in Peoria side sessions. Then Kirby sat 97-99 throughout his time at the alt site and again during the spring of 2021. The context of all these looks is important, and there is risk of regression during the full-season slog, but because Kirby's velo bump coincided with a change in physicality, I'm more inclined to believe it will hold. Even with fairly vanilla secondary stuff, mid-90s heat and Kirby's potential for elite command gives him a mid-rotation ceiling. <em>(Alternate site)</em>",,"sa3011526"

In 2019, as many orgs have done, Mariners catchers began working on one knee, a move that tends to be favorable for framing but not for throwing, a skill of dwindling importance (at least for now). Perhaps not coincidentally (or perhaps because we were wrong about Raleigh's arm grade last year, when we 55'ed it), reports on Raleigh's arm strength are worse than they were a year ago, though it appears he's a viable long-term catcher, if an unspectacular one. He popped anywhere from 1.9 to 2.04 for me during the spring, but Raleigh's throws tend to drift away from the bag. So while he isn't a run-stopping defensive wizard, Raleigh does enough to catch, and switch-hitting catchers with power like this are rare. 
And I'm pretty confident about him getting to most of the power in games. Raleigh hit 29 homers in 2019 (most of those coming in the Cal League), he's typically run groundball rates in the low 30% range (meaning he hits the ball in the air a lot), and the sourced TrackMan data to which we have access reinforces the visual evaluation of Raleigh's strength and power. He projects as an everyday catcher and is a Pick to Click to make next year's top 100 who needs to be added to the 40-man this offseason. He could claim the lion's share of big league catching duties next year. <em>(Alternate site)</em>",,"sa3008377"

Remember that he was once a 60 FV prospect on here, one who looked like a shockingly polished low-minors hitter with an old school leadoff man's skillset. I simply don't think he was seeing a high concentration of big league velocity at that time, and a significant weakness went unexposed until Trammell began to face upper-level competition and his performance changed. The skills foundation that made him a former top prospect remains: Trammell sees a lot of pitches and should run above-average OBPs, he runs well, and will either end up playing a viable center field, or a dynamic left field. I've typically projected Trammell to left due to lack of arm strength. Generally, I think most teams have a superior outfield defender who'll play every day in center and instead have been comp'ing Trammell's overall skill set to Brett Gardner's for a while, though his feel for contact clearly isn't as good as Gardner's. Trammell's swing makes it tough for him to get on top of high fastballs (though he's often really close) and he's also apt to swing over breaking balls. Basically his swinging strike rates against all pitches (he's seen about 500 of them already) are all below-average. I have him evaluated as a versatile platoon outfielder. <em>(Alternate site)</em>","Xeh5cE_M4ew","19960"

This is the pitch Brash has the best feel for, and he's consistently able to locate it to his glove side, where it moves the most and is the most enticing to hitters. He'll back that up with an occasional curveball (it was his fourth pitch in college but is probably third in line now) and changeup. The slider and velocity give him an impact relief floor (assuming health) but remember that we're talking about a small school prospect who missed what would have been his first full pro season of development due to the pandemic.

He had a velocity spike over the 2019-20 offseason and, after sitting 91-95 and topping out at 96 in '19, was up to 99 mph in the bullpen last spring before baseball ceased operations due to the pandemic. Similar to the way Vanderbilt and Kyle Wright found an extra gear for his fastball before the draft, a lower, more naturally comfortable arm slot for Then is part of what seems to have brought this about (along with physical maturity). His well-located sliders are easily plus. Then's delivery is silky smooth for a guy who's often parked in the upper-90s, so I think there's a shot he develops a more consistent release and feel for that slider, which would help him outperform some of the relief projections that currently befall him. A better changup (or some other third pitch) will be needed, as well. Because of his size, athleticism, relative mechanical ease, and the fact that his third pitch needs work, it makes sense to develop Then as a starter for as long as possible to see if things click.

After the 2019 draft, in one- and two-inning outings, he sat 92-95 with a plus curveball (and fewer, if any, sliders). I'm skeptical that Williamson can hold 92-95 as a starter for a whole season because of how his stuff has waned in the past and because the 2020 shutdown created a gigantic roadblock preventing a natural innings increase. He also suffered a severe hip injury while in junior college (he tore both labrums dunking a basketball and needed surgery) that might impact his ability to do it.

His delivery's pace and the way he gets down the mound are helping his fastball jump on hitters even though it isn't that hard, and I think his slider will play as plus because of his command.

He spent the summer before his draft year sitting in the low-90s and working with a better changeup and better command than is typical for a cold-weather, two-way player. His big, strapping frame portended more velocity. The following year, that velo arrived, and Carlson sat 93-97 for stretches of his pre-draft spring. Seattle drafted him in the second round, gave him $2 million, and Carlson made two starts in the AZL before he was quickly shut down. He had Tommy John and had a season wiped away by the pandemic, all of which piled up to nearly four years between when Carlson threw his last pitch in affiliated ball in 2017 to when he threw his next one, at Low-A in early 2021. 
His peak velocity has not returned, and Carlson has been more in the 91-93 range, topping out at 94, with some carry and tail. His arm action is still fairly long, his delivery has some head violence, and at a physical 22-years-old, I don't consider him a likely candidate to add velocity. His new-ish curveball has good back-foot angle against lefties and enough depth to miss bats, while his changeup remains a fair offering with tailing action. The entire package looks like a fifth starter (a 40) right now, but the way individuals in baseball either round up or down on that projection depends on what part of Carlson's prospectdom they choose to look at. Look at his draft pedigree and there's hope for more than that; look at his actual performance track record and there's skepticism. He needs to pitch well enough to be added to the 40-man this offseason and nobody is sure how his stuff and health will respond to a full-season workload after he's never even come close to pitching deep into season.

The Mariners and Stoudt used his TJ rehab to rework his slider shape. His arm strength has returned after surgery and he's once again sitting in the mid-90s. If the slider's new shape improves its results, Stoudt will still need to develop sufficient control/command to start. His roster timeline (he doesn't need to be added to the 40 until after 2022) gives him a longer developmental runway, but for now I have him projected as a fastball/changeup middle reliever. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3014545"

He has still managed to generate a 13% swinging strike rate against big league hitters while parked in the 91-93 range. He does have a plus changeup and throws an obnoxious rate of strikes, which almost always is enough to be some kind of contributor on a pitching staff. Newsome's smoke and mirrors have worked as a starter up through High-A and Mariners saw fit to push him straight to the big leagues from there. He's only gone about two or three innings per outing in the bigs and his FIP stats indicate a regression is coming, but Newsome has pitched well in a limited sample at the highest level. Elbow inflammation now has him on the shelf and may result in Tommy John. It impacts Newsome's timeline but not the role I expect him to play, which is that of a 1 WAR swingman or long reliever. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>",,"19942"
