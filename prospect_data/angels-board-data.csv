"Jo Adell","LAA","LF",,4,1,,"65",2021,,"21.2666666","6' 3""","215","R","R",2017,"Draft","LAA",4300000,"Ballard HS (KY)","The baseball-loving world held its collective breath last year when Adell went down with two freak leg injuries on the same spring training play (while going from first to third, he strained his left hamstring, then sprained his right ankle trying to stop himself when he felt the pull) and was shelved for a couple of months. While his gait appeared compromised during Extended spring rehab outings, Adell was asymptomatic throughout the summer and during the Arizona Fall League. After a brief jaunt in the Cal League, the Angels sent him to Double-A Mobile, where he'd had a strikeout-laden cup of coffee the year before. He adjusted, cut the strikeout rate down to a very livable 22%, and hit .308/.390/.553 over two months before he was sent to Triple-A in August. Again, Adell struck out a lot when he was challenged, and there are people in baseball who worry about how often he K's, but he was just 20 years old and has had success amid many swing changes since he signed, a common theme among Angels prospects. 
Adell's leg kick has been altered; he now raises it even with his waist at apex, and the height at which his hands load (as well as the angle of his bat when they do) was quite nomadic throughout last year. By the time Adell was done with Fall League and had joined Team USA's Premier12 Olympic qualifying efforts, he had a Gary Sheffield-style bat wrap. Adell is one of the best athletes in the minors (there's video of him box jumping 66 inches online) and the fact that's he's been able to manifest these adjustments on the field at will is incredible. Even if something mechanical isn't working in the future, chances are he'll be able to fix it. I've settled on projecting Adell in left field. The arm strength he showed as an amateur, when he was into the mid-90s as a pitcher, never totally returned after it mysteriously evaporated during his senior year of high school. He has a 40 arm and is such a hulking dude that he's just going to be a corner defender at maturity. Strikeouts may limit Adell's productivity when he's initially brought up, but I think eventually he'll be a middle-of-the-order force who hits 35-plus homers.","tpQIfgNoqIE","sa3004837"

Marsh still hit the ball on the ground a lot during the regular season and only averaged about five degrees of launch angle, but by his Fall League stint things clearly looked different. Like Jo Adell showed late in the fall, Marsh's hands loaded a little farther out away from his body and he had what some scouts called a ""wrap"" or ""power tip,"" where the bat head angled toward the mound a bit, setting up more of a loop than a direct path to the ball. I thought he lifted the ball better during that six week stretch and did so without compromising his strong feel for contact. Marsh is a better outfield defender that Adell and projects as a clean fit in center field, which, so long as this development holds, should enable him to be an above-average everday player.","f6w57ie4WkA","sa917944"
"Jordyn Adams","LAA","CF",,83,3,,"50",2023,,"20.7388888","6' 2""","180","R","R",2018,"Draft","LAA",,"Green Hope HS (NC)","Adams was seen as a football-first prospect until late March of 2018. He played at a couple of showcase events in the summer of 2017 and had some raw tools, but wasn't yet under consideration for the top few rounds of the baseball draft. He was, however, a top 100 football recruit, set to head to North Carolina to play wide receiver, where his father was on the coaching staff. Then in March, Adams had a coming out party at the heavily-scouted NHSI tournament near his high school. Multiple scouts from all 30 teams watched him against strong competition for a few days, and he looked very, very good, much more comfortable than expected given his level of experience. Scouts were hesitant at first, worried they might be overreacting, but eventually they came to think that Adams' only athletic peer in recent draft history was Byron Buxton. Teams assessed his signability and the Angels were comfortable using their first rounder on him. 
He didn't play much during that first pro summer, but the Angels surprisingly skipped him over the Pioneer League and sent him right to full-season ball, even though he'd only been solely focused on baseball for a year. Adams had a slightly above-average statline there, which is incredible for someone who only just picked up a bat. He is built like you probably expect a D-I wide receiver recruit to be built, he's an 80 runner, and while the swing foundation isn't great, the Angels are one of the most proactive, swing-changing orgs. Adams' rare physical gifts make him a potential star, though more advanced pitching will probably be a real challenge for him this year.","dsaEZPyd02Y","sa3008032"
"Reid Detmers","LAA","LHP",,,4,,"45+",2020,,"21.0166666","6' 2""","210","L","L",2020,"Draft","LAA",,"Louisville","Detmers' curveball is hell's rainbow, especially for left-handed hitters who think it's headed for their lips, bail, and watch it bend into the zone. There's some doubt about it playing in pro ball the way it has in college both because it's a slower pitch in the mid-70s and because its huge arc is easy to see out of his hand. Righty batters can wait forever before making a decision against the curveball but it's still been tough for college bats to touch because it has such cartoonish depth. He also works his heater in on the hands of righties and can run it off their hip and back into the zone for looking strikes. That approach with those two pitches has largely enabled Detmers to strike out 284 hitters in 191 career innings. He's a higher variance prospect than is typical for a college pitcher who has performed like this, because even if you buy that Detmers' fastball and curveball will play in the big leagues he needs a clearer third pitch, which will probably be a changeup. I'm a little more skeptical than what I perceive the industry median to be, but still think Detmers has a better chance to start or has been healthier than the other college ptchers in this tier.","mk06YYkpDQk",

Paris' pre-draft profile existed at the intersection of traits a lot of models seem to prioritize (chiefly, his age) and old school scouting (this was one of the 2019 draft's best athletes with one of its most projectable builds). Paris is really fast, might be capable of staying at shortstop (and should stay on the middle of the diamond if he can't), and his feel to hit was much better during his draft spring than it was the summer before. Some teams thought it was just a product of him facing weaker pitching, while others thought he was truly emerging and cited his age as evidence that the late improvement was legitimate. A broken hamate limited Paris to just three games after last year's draft. He arrived to camp this spring looking absolutely yoked, and he has a chance to hit for some power sooner than I anticipated a year ago. I still consider him a slow-burning prospect with a high ceiling (a leadoff hitting middle infield or center fielder) but it's possible things will come together sooner than I initially anticipated based on how physical Paris worked to become during the offseason.",,"sa3011768"

He's currently skinny as a rail, but Vera is one of these prospects and has a chance to mature in the Goldilocks Zone, where he stays lithe and athletic enough to remain at short but also grows into impact power. He took some good cuts in the Fall during intrasquads, but if Vera worked deep into counts and swung several times during the same at-bat, his later swings weren't as controlled and strong. He needs to get stronger. I'm a bit less confident in Vera filling out than I was with Ronny Mauricio at the same age just because Vera's physical composition is a little narrower and more slender, but if he does, his swing is already in a better spot to hit for power than Mauricio.","5rXyBVQAjmI",

It created a bit more tail on his changeup, which Sandoval has surprisingly good arm-side command of despite his vertically-oriented slot. Assuming his strike-throwing regresses to career norms, I have Sandoval evaluated as a big league ready No. 4/5 starter.",,"19447"
"Jeremiah Jackson","LAA","3B","R",,8,,"45",2022,,"20.3","6' 0""","175","R","R",2018,"Draft","LAA",,"St. Luke's Episcopal HS (AL)","Jackson's swing has already been tailored for extreme lift and power. He only hit 29% of his balls in play on the ground last year (down from 42% the year before) and averaged a 20 degree launch angle (second highest in the org behind Trent Deveaux), which would put him among the 10 steepest swingers among qualified big leaguers last year. He hit 23 homers in 65 games, and while that number was inflated by the league's hitting environment, to the naked eye, he clearly has explosive hands and big power. Scouts who saw him last summer were all scared of this swing, with one going so far as to say it's ""jacked up."" They worry the lack of contact (33% strikeout rate last year) won't enable him to get to that power against upper-level pitching, and that as Jackson slides down the defensive spectrum (he's likely to move to third base), it might make it tough for him to profile. 
That he has a chance to stay at short, or on the infield at all, and hit for big game power means Jackson's got an airplane hangar's ceiling, but he's a prospect of extreme risk. I'm optimistic that, because he's already been able to make adjustments, he'll continue to do so.","cy7v3sfh_sU","sa3007740"

Like Peralta, he's best-suited to attack hitters with a lot of fastballs. Several aspects of Yan's delivery enable his heater to dominate even though he only averaged 92 mph last year. He's a long-armed side-armer with a cross-bodied delivery, which means he is releasing the ball way behind the backs of left-handed hitters, and his fastball has weird angle in on the hands of righties. The rest of the repertoire isn't great. Yan's slider lives almost entirely off of his arm slot and really only works against left-handed hitters, and he doesn't throw his changeup with conviction yet. I think he'll move to the bullpen where I believe he'll experience a velo bump and work with a 70-grade heater. He'll still need to develop a way to deal with righties to pitch in high-leverage spots. If he does, he'll be a high-leverage arm.","EboHSr3UyHU","sa917194"

Prior to Rodriguez's shutdown in 2018, he had experienced a velo spike (93-97, up from 91-94 the year before) and lowered his arm slot. Both of his breaking balls were excellent, but his changeup had regressed a bit compared to his first year (or at least, he lacked feel for it the last time I saw him). The injury adds fuel to the speculative fire that Rodriguez's violent delivery will eventually limit him to the bullpen. It didn't prohibit him from having starter control, but scouts were concerned about injury. Now, there's been one. If health eventually moves Rodriguez to the bullpen, he has high-leverage stuff. If not, and his changeup returns, he could be a No. 3 or 4 starter.","XVIkcyUC3as","sa917980"

At the time, he was a typical, frame-based power projection outfield prospect at a lean, high-waisted, broad-shouldered 6-foot-2. But Ramirez has grown into serious power more quickly than anticipated. In fact, his 95 mph average exit velo was the highest in the entire DSL last year. He also struck out a lot, and corner bats who punch out at this rate at any level, let alone against bad DSL pitching, are inherently volatile. I saw Ramirez in the fall and I don't think he's 6-foot-2 anymore; to me, he looked closer to 6-foot-4 and didn't look maxed out physically. I think he still has a ton of room on his frame and a chance to grow into elite raw power, but of course the feel to hit really hasn't been tested yet, and it's a necessary component for corner players.",,"sa3008757"

He ran an unusually low BABIP last year, his underlying TrackMan data was still favorable (39% of balls in play hit 95 mph or above), and he was a college-aged player who spent all of last year at Double-A. I'm still betting on Jones' makeup and athleticism, and think he'll find a way to be a 1.5 to 2 WAR role player who sees time at second base and in left field.","J40IH-lAmOs","sa874807"

He didn't hit especially well -- .240/.310/.387 -- but was 2.5 years younger than the average player in that league. That's not to say Knowles' bat doesn't need polish. His left-handed swing (this system has a lot of switch-hitters) is pretty grooved, and I think he's likely to be strikeout prone from that side for good. From the right side, he might be able to do real damage. Knowles needs more reps in center as his reads on balls are mixed. Again, Knowles is a 19-year-old switch hitter and it's possible that his feel to hit from the left side still develops. If it doesn't, he easily projects as a fourth outfielder who could be the short half of a platoon at any outfield spot.","OQUHC-_sNFg","sa3006889"

A $700,000 bonus brought him to Tempe for a summer free of pitching in games, an approach the Angels have taken with several recent draftees. He's begun to emerge as a pitching prospect, showing refined command of three viable pitches late last summer.

This kind of bat control is rare for anyone, let alone a switch-hitter this age.

Even if his walk rate comes down, Rivas does enough other stuff to contribute to a big league roster. He won't hit homers, but he stings high-quality line drive contact to all-fields and can slash doubles down the third base line. He has sufficient speed and range for the middle infield, and has experience at every position but first base and catcher, though he hasn't played the outfield since 2015. Rivas' most realistic path to everyday production involves him retaining something close to his current walk rate, but he's more likely to become a valuable utility man who can play all over the field, and is a fairly high-probability prospect in that regard.","Tbf-2kCq_yI","sa872542"

At the same time, he does have speed, defensive versatility, advantageous handedness, and is only 20, so if he gets stronger, he could be a good bench piece.","0hR-tE7cLSo","sa3004264"

He's still a good-framed 21-year-old, and I wonder where the fastball would live in relief.","vF8L7nI0g0U","sa3002911"
