His surface-level stats are strong, especially the OBP (he boasts a career .409 mark) because Jones walks at a career 17% clip. His splits against lefties are very troubling, such that some of my sources thought it would limit Jones' role enough to move him toward the back of the overall top 100 list. I think the plate discipline will offset that enough that he's a corner infield regular with among the highest three true outcomes percentages in the big leagues.","M8MOVqKoFgA","sa917941"

Injuries sustained in a car accident necessitated that metal rods be inserted in Valera's father's limbs, and the move was a way of providing him physical comfort in a warmer climate. It also meant Valera became an international prospect rather than an American high school draftee, and when he was eligible, he signed with Cleveland for $1.3 million. 
As they've done with their advanced complex-level hitters in recent years, the Indians sent Valera to the Penn League, which is full of college pitching. He thrived for a month and then started to strike out a lot, whiffing in 28% of plate appearances overall. He has a sweet lefty swing with natural lift and he has considerable present power, but most of the industry sees him as a corner guy who has had strikeout issues the little he's played away from Goodyear. I like his instincts in center field and think he has a shot to stay there, but teenagers built like this typically do not.","kGbEJq13Uzw","sa3006872"

He had the 16th-lowest swinging strike rate in the minors last year, one of four Cleveland hitters hovering around the 4% mark.

The loudest of those are his elite arm strength, premium speed, and, to a lesser extent, above-average raw power that manifests as doubles in games because Johnson's swing really only enables home run power to his pull side. 
At one point, Johnson was so raw that some scouts wanted to see him on the mound, but he's performed consistently all the way through Triple-A, slashing .284/.344/.460 as a pro. That's close to the league-average line for outfielders, so why not include Johnson on the top 100? His relative lack of defensive instincts make him more of a fit in right field than in center and I think big league arms will be able to pitch to him in a way that limits his power output below the corner outfield average. His line may be elevated by Cleveland's propensity for platooning, which would limit his role/output from a volume standpoint. I have Johnson as a second-division outfield regular or favorable platoon piece -- almost always a 45 FV -- and I'm rounding up a bit on his grade because his tools are so electric.","_vyB942sM98","sa918018"

But their enthusiasm is almost always tempered by fear of the profile: a teenager with elite arm strength, a long-ish arm action, and a big, hulking upper body similar to Brady Quinn's. If Espino continues on his current track, he'll be an All-Star. In limited post-draft innings -- one or two frames per outing for his first several pro appearances, then three to four for his final few -- Espino sat 94-97 and touched 99 with two plus breaking balls and starter's command. Whether he retains that level of heat over an entire season's worth of innings on regular rest (he was 92-97 in longer starts before the draft) we simply don't know, but there's no reason to think Espino is any more of an injury risk than other teenage pitchers unless you twist your brain into knots and conclude that his velocity is somehow a negative. Even if he loses some gas with a pro innings load, Espino could still have three plus pitches at maturity and pitch near the top of a competitive rotation.","zAx9kazFtDc","sa3011495"

More impressive still, though perhaps not surprising, was that Naylor responded and performed, slashing .243/.313/.421 (good for a 110 wRC+) while dealing with the physical toll of catching 80 games. 
Not only has Naylor kept his body in check as a pro (Bo's older brother, Josh, is a bigger guy who is limited on defense, and the amateur side of the industry was somewhat worried Bo might develop in a similar fashion), he's actually more sculpted and athletic now than he was in high school, and he's likely to catch, if unspectacularly, long-term. So long as that remains true, Naylor has a good chance to be an everyday player. His swing's a little grooved, but it is electric and produces big power for anyone, let alone a catcher. If he gets to most of it in games, and he has so far (he had strong amateur statistical performance, as well), there's plenty of room for him to profile even if he ends up as a 40 bat, which I think is possible considering the lack of barrel variability.","4SxNI1qCt10","sa3008247"

Perhaps Torres' control is behind because, as a cold-weather amateur prospect, he hasn't pitched all that much. He only threw around 40 innings during his senior spring, and bad suburban high school hitters in New York couldn't catch his fastball. As a result, Torres had little cause to use his changeup during varsity play -- some national evaluators would go whole starts without seeing it -- but it flashed 55 or 60 during his showcase summer and was easy to dream on. 
Perhaps the most striking aspect of Torres' post-draft performance was how regularly he located his slider down and to his glove side. He has mid-rotation components if you're willing to dream based on his athleticism, age, and geographic background, even coming off of last year's surgery - the date of this list's publication is a year and a few days removed from the TJ.","oQt2oGijG8Q","sa3008329"

It was his second straight injury-riddled campaign, as he missed the spring of 2018 with upper back issues, and performed beneath career norms when he returned (33% K% from 2015-'17, 24% in '18), though in fairness to him, he was a 19-year-old pitching at Double-A for the first time. There was pre-draft consternation regarding McKenzie's frame, which, much like Kevin Durant's coming out of Texas, was so lean that it existed somewhere between ""projectable"" and ""concerningly thin,"" causing some scouts/teams to worry about durability. 
In the five years since he was drafted, McKenzie has added five pounds of reported weight (he was listed at 160 on draft day, and is now 165); his fastball, at peak, was 90-93, touching 95 (88-92 in high school) and was 90-94 in camp this spring before the shutdown. The way his delivery and fastball work -- it's deceptive, creates flat angle at the top of the zone, and really carries -- makes me think it'll play at that velocity, and the same is true of McKenzie's curveball, which has good depth depite bad spin rates. He needs to find a third pitch, and hasn't really had a chance to do that for two years because of the injuries. At this point, I think it's more likely to be a slider/cutter than a changeup, which I think would be further along now if it were going to work. 
If he can't find a third pitch, I'm not sure what the role is. McKenzie throws a ton of strikes, so you want him to start, but without a viable third offering that's pretty tough. High-leverage relief types typically have a better two-pitch mix than even a healthy McKenzie does, so a single-inning relief role doesn't seem like a great option, and the bulk relief role is often occupied by lower slot changeup guys, not overhand curveball types. I'm willing to bet on the atheticism here to fill in the blank.","SaiUEE5AOzQ","sa874760"

The reason? Oviedo's velocity was all over the place in 2019. Depending on when scouts saw him last year, he was either up to 96 or sitting in the mid-80s, and was eventually shut down with lower back soreness. This spring, however, he was parked at 94 and up to 98. We're not all that far removed from Oviedo striking out 61 and walking just 10 in 48 innings as a teenager in the New York-Penn League. At age 21, I have him valued where I have a bunch of the college power arms in the 2020 draft, which includes a bunch of guys with shorter or mixed track records. I had healthy Oviedo projected as a fourth starter. I'm in more of a wait-and-see mindset with the role, depending on how the velo and workload interact in the near future, but still think we're looking at a valuable member of a pitching staff.",,"sa917344"

Now two inches taller than when he signed, Hentges is a huge-framed 6-foot-8, comes from a cold-weather location (he's not even the most famous Sam Hentges from Minnesota, as another is a hockey prospect for the Wild), and lost a year to surgery. That he's still raw at age 24 really isn't all that surprising, nor do I find it particularly concerning, though admittedly some of that confidence comes from knowing how hard Hentges was throwing in his three big league outings this spring before the shutdown; in those brief outings, Hentges was living in the 96-99 range after sitting 92 (peaking at 96) last year. Cleveland did not baby his innings after he returned from TJ and perhaps 2019 was a bit of a stuff hangover year for him. If he holds this new velo, even if he only does so out of the bullpen, that kind of fastball and Hentges' breaking ball are enough to make him a big relief piece. He has crude changeup feel and it seemed to be a focus for him during his spring outings. There's still a chance that comes along (remember, this guy has all the late bloomer traits) and Hentges can start, but the (healthy) floor of a lefty reliever who throws as hard as he does is still exciting even if he can't.",,"sa828881"

At that point, he was commanding a lively 93-96 mph heater, a new, but already plus slider, and an at least average changeup that he didn't need to use much. He looked a little rusty early during his senior spring, then walked off the mound with tightness in a shoulder muscle tied behind the joint. He returned over a month later and threw hard down the stretch, peaking at 97 mph in multiple open workouts for scouts after his school was eliminated from the playoffs. And that's where Hankins' velocity was in 2019. In 70-to-80 pitch outings, he sat 93-96, topping out at 97, albeit with worse control than he had as a high schooler. At various points as an amateur Hankins appeared to utilize either a slider or curveball, and now he uses both. They are better demarcated now then when he was an amateur and both flash plus when located. With Hankins' arm slot, the secondary pitch that best mirrors his fastball (which has tailing action because of his slot) is actually the changeup. 
Hankins has gotten a little soft-bodied since signing and I wonder if it has impacted his athleticism and control, but he was also working to tweak his lower half usage to help him get on top of his breaking ball, which might have affected his mechanical consistency last year. I'm not ready to explicitly project him in the bullpen but between the injury stuff and 2019 strike throwing, it's objectively trending that way.","UxRnkfMPC7g","sa3008589"

What's most exciting about Martinez, though, is how advanced and potent both of his swings are for a teenage switch-hitter. He's a shorter-levered guy, so both cuts are relatively short, which helps aid Martinez's bat-to-ball ability. The wrists drive what is currently doubles power (because of his speed, some triples too), both in raw pop and approach. He has a pull-oriented approach as a righty hitter, and while Martinez can lift balls down-and-in as a lefty, his swing is mostly geared for all-fields line drive contact from that side.

Bracho can really hit. He's patient and poised. He'll take giant hacks in hitter's counts and more measured ones when he's adjusting to a breaking ball or just trying to put a ball in play. There's not a lot of body projection here despite Bracho's age. He's got a square, 5-foot-11-ish frame and is already physically mature.

He was a polished college hitter who walked 52 times and struck out just 16 as a junior at Towson while also swiping an ultra-efficient 25 bases in 26 attempts, and he hit .360/.420/.538 against low-level pro pitching after he signed. He's a nearly plus-plus runner and capable middle infield defender (probably at second) with premium hand-eye coordination and bat control. There was some concern that Palacios beat up on small conference pitching his entire career, and that he may not replicate that performance against pro pitching, a concern Palacios hasn't yet had the opportunity to allay.",,"sa3006908"

He has a minimalistic swing and excellent hand-eye coordination, which have enabled him to run about an 8.5% strikeout rate the last two seasons. He's also a capable defensive shortstop. Players like this often outperform eyeball-only evaluations and, heuristically, a hitter like this with almost elite bat-to-ball skills who also plays a premium position typically ends up in a higher FV tier than this. But in Fermin's case, I think he lacks the power on contact to be an everyday player. I realize those can be famous last words when it comes to a profile like this one, but in this case I think the power is limiting and I have a low-variance bench infield grade on Fermin.",,"sa917339"

Morris' innings count is important because he was throwing really hard, especially early in the year, before wavering late.

Typically a fly ball hitter, his groundball rate increased 10% points from 32% in 2018 to 42% last season. He's become pretty stiff and upright in the batter's box, which makes it hard for him to get underneath pitches and lift them. I still like the way his hands work, but he can only do damage in a limited slice of the zone with the swing he currently has.
