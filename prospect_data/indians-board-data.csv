Defensive versatility is valuable on its own, and this was also a logical trial given Cleveland's situation at the corner spots. Carlos Santana has departed, the club's outfield was below replacement level in 2020, and one of the better hitters on the planet is already the club's third sacker. But regardless of the circumstance, there is a contingent of scouts who think Jones has already outgrown third base. He's stretched two additional (listed) inches since high school and now stands in at a long-legged 6-foot-4. Though his ridiculous arm enables him to make some tough plays, Jones' size has an impact on his defensive footwork and mobility. 
But ultimately, it doesn't really matter where Jones plays, because he has a special offensive skill set that will likely profile anywhere. Not only does he have big raw power, but Jones has perhaps the best strike zone discipline in the entire minor leagues. He ran a 20% walk rate across a 100-game sample as a 21-year-old at Hi-A, then posted a 14.7% rate at Double-A (he had turned 22 by then) to wrap up 2019. Jones has the highest walk rate (17.9%) the last two years among minor leaguers who have reached at least Double-A, and there are only five other hitters his age or younger who are within three percentage points of him. That patience combined with high-end raw power (he has the fourth-highest max exit velo among prospects on The Board) that Jones hasn't yet totally tapped into should enable him to be a cleanup-hitting force. 
There's some platoon-y, strikeout risk here. Jones struck out a lot his short Double-A trial and then in the 2019 Arizona Fall League. He's not good against left-handed pitching and will need to be dropped in the lineup against lefties, and sometimes come off the bench. But again, Jones has elite feel for the zone and huge power. His skillset is a scaled down version of Adam Dunn's or Joey Gallo's, and quite similar to Pat Burrell's (other than the handedness). <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>","S1tP3qEVSW8","sa917941"

Not only was he healthy, but he was throwing harder, at least for a little while. His fastball sat in the 90-93 range in 2018 and was 90-94 this spring as he prepared for the season. Then McKenzie was living in the 93-96 range in his first start and leaned on the fastball in big spots, often shaking off Roberto Pérez to get to it. Over the next few weeks, McKenzie's velocity dropped in each subsequent start before it spiked again in a long relief role at the very end of the season. You could argue the injuries and fluctuating velocity are indications that the long-held industry apprehension regarding McKenzie's durability has turned out to be correct. But it also would have been unreasonable to expect any pitcher to hold their velocity as they got deeper into their first extended action in quite a while. The action on McKenzie's fastball also gives it some margin for error, velo-wise. And both his slider and changeup have evolved to complement the fastball/curveball combo that had headlined his arsenal as a younger prospect. Even though it's still unclear exactly where his fastball velocity band will sit during the course of a whole season, I think McKenzie has the necessary other components to pitch in the middle of a rotation. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>","SaiUEE5AOzQ","18000"

Since signing in 2017, he's only played a total of 58 affiliated games and punched out in nearly 30% of his plate appearances. But let's remember that he was one of the youngest players in the 2018 New York-Penn League (typically a league for college players -- Valera was 18) season during which most of the strikeouts were accrued, and instead shift our focus to those who have seen Valera on the Arizona backfields, where he has easily spent the most time since signing. 
There, including in the Fall of 2020, Valera has the best combination of feel for contact and power among his peers in this system. Among the other teenagers, Valera looks like a jazz bassist jamming with a group of teenagers who taught themselves the guitar using Blink-182 tabs. He has great in-the-box rhythm and timing, unloading on pitches with veteran anticipation. When Valera's curt, all-fields uppercut swing connects just right, you'd swear you were watching a young Robinson Canó, and like Canó, Valera is going to hit some emphatic, picturesque dingers. While his swinging style will likely always cause him to whiff more than average, he has the most potent hit/power combination in this system and there are scouts who think he should be ranked first in the org. Because he has so little actual pro experience, he is likely to play a corner outfield spot -- I liked Valera's defensive instincts enough to keep him alive in center field on last year's list, but folks who saw him this Fall only watched him in right, so center seems to less likely to me now --and due to his track record of swinging and missing, other scouts think he should slide behind the hit-first middle infielders ranked a few spots behind him here. It's very important for Valera to have a full, healthy 2021 since he's part of huge contingent of prospects who need to be added to the 40-man next offseason. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>","kGbEJq13Uzw","sa3006872"

I did update some of his tool grades based on continued discussion with scouts, including those who saw a bit of him before the March 2020 shutdown. Even though he's only 20, I consider Rocchio a high-probability everyday big leaguer by virtue of his advanced feel for contact and exceptional shortstop defense. So fundamentally sound is Rocchio that Cleveland was willing to give him some big league spring training reps each of the last two years, when he was still just a teenager with mostly backfield experience. He looked comfortable, both in the field and at the plate, in that handful of games. He has great range, hands, footwork, and just enough arm strength for the left side of the infield, since it's enabled by the quickness of his actions. Rocchio’s 2019 triple slash line at Mahoning Valley (.250/.310/.373) is not all that impressive at first glance, but it was enough for a 107 wRC+ at the level, and he was just 18. The physical development that might lead to a real breakout (and his ascension up the top 100) has not yet materialized, and because Rocchio is a smaller-framed young man, it may never come.

Ultimately, the carrying tool here is Freeman's bat. He tracks pitches like a hawk tracks prey from a half mile in the sky and guides the bat head to them with rare consistency. For such a short-levered hitter, Freeman has great plate coverage. He's able to dive and get the bat head to pitches out away from him, and he's typically willing to hit the ball where it's pitched in a refreshing, 20th-century way. He had the 16th-lowest swinging strike rate in the minors in 2019, one of four Cleveland hitters hovering around the 4% mark. Though unlikely to hit for power (based both on his lack of present power and limited physical projection), a potential plus-plus hitter who plays the middle of the diamond is an everyday player. They may need a one-year stopgap, but Freeman is likely to get the first shot to replace Cesar Hernandez at second. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>","eOEmTzaPck0","sa3004755"

Instead he pitched manicured innings at the alternate site, then did some remote development before instructs, where Espino did not throw in games due to a minor shoulder injury. This comes after he was only allowed to throw one or two frames per outing for his first several pro appearances, then three to four for his final few -- Espino sat 94-97 and touched 99 with two plus breaking balls and starter's command during those. Whether he retains that level of heat over an entire season's worth of innings on regular rest (he was 92-97 in longer starts before the draft) we simply don't know, but there's no reason to think he is any more of an injury risk than other teenage pitchers unless you twist your brain into knots and conclude that his velocity is somehow a negative, or that he strength trains excessively. 
His arm action is atypical and quite long, similar to Madison Bumgarner's, but it works for Espino. If, like Bumgarner, Espino loses some velocity even before he reaches the majors, be it due to a pro workload or injury, I think he has a command-centric, four-pitch strike-thrower outcome. His changeup is much better than I gave it credit for last year, and realizing that during calls with scouts to prep for this list is why Espino is moving up a FV tier even tough he was kept at the alt site all year. He's an All-Star talent with a risky profile. <em>(Alternate site, at-home dev)</em>","zAx9kazFtDc","sa3011495"

Still just the age of a junior college player, he has thus far kept what scouts thought might be a high-maintenance body in check. In fact, Naylor looked as lean and twitchy as ever in the Fall. While remaining agile, he also showed he could produce on offense while dealing with the physical grind of catching, slashing .243/.313/.421 (good for a 110 wRC+) in the 2019 Midwest League while catching 80 games. 
His swing's a little grooved, but it is electric and produces big power for anyone, let alone a catcher. If he gets to most of it in games, and he has so far (he had strong amateur statistical performance, as well), there's plenty of room for him to profile even if he ends up as a 40 bat, which I think is possible considering the lack of barrel variability. If he performs against Hi-A pitching early in 2021 and reinforces confidence in his ability to hit, he'll move onto the Top 100. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>","4SxNI1qCt10","sa3008247"

Except for a little bit of extended spring action, he missed all of 2018 with a broken arm and then lost a month of 2019 to an oblique injury. That has made it hard to evaluate his defense at length. I had him projected in left field last offseason but scouts who I spoke to regarding his Fall performance unanimously think I should keep him alive at second base, albeit as a below-average fielder there. I should note that several of those scouts came from orgs whose philosophy regarding infield defense is more inclusive than average. Regardless, it's fair to project on Bracho's defense because he hasn't had many pro reps at second base yet. 
What's important is that Bracho can really hit. He's stout and strong and hits balls much harder than is typical for someone with a frame this compact. He's patient and poised at the dish and clearly has an approach. He'll take giant hacks in hitter's counts and more measured ones when he's adjusting to a breaking ball or just trying to put a ball in play, though his swing looks a little long at times. His bat head can take a deeper path to the bottom of the zone but it's still usually on time because Bracho's levers are so short. He's quite polished for a hitter who won't turn 20 until near the start of the 2021 season. There's not a lot of body projection here despite Bracho's age. He's got a square, 5-foot-11-ish frame and is already physically mature. The lack of affiliated data here probably means the max exit velo listed for Bracho on The Board is less than he's capable of producing, and someone from outside the org told me they saw him hit a ball 450 feet over the batter's eye at the Reds place during a Fall game. I'd like to see him perform in more than 35 games to stick him in the Top 100, so for now consider Bracho a likely mid- or post-season addition with a profile similar to that of Shed Long and Nick Solak, both recent top 100 types. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>","KgDmgu7Ljlg","sa3010018"

Arias was part of San Diego’s huge 2016 international signing class, inking a deal worth just shy of $2 million. He quickly became the most promising of the young infielders the club signed that year and was pushed to full season ball late during his age-17 season, well out ahead of the others in his class. After a rough statistical 2018 as a very young player at Low-A Fort Wayne, Arias had a great 2019 on paper, hitting .302/.339/.470 as a 19-year-old at Hi-A Lake Elsinore. 
Arias looks like a stud at five o'clock when he's taking batting practice and infield, but his in-game swing decisions have been a problem, and were even during that statistically impressive 2019. The Padres threw every developmental trick in the book at him during the 2019-20 offseason, including virtual reality training, to try to get him to better identify balls from strikes, and chase less often. In a small spring sample, it appeared to be working -- Arias played some spring games in the place of Fernando Tatis Jr., who was one of several Padres to miss time with flu-like symptoms during the spring before baseball shut down. The importance of Arias' approach extends beyond his on base ability to his power production. His swing is grooved, making the parts of the zone where he can do real damage limited, so for him to get to his power in games he's not only going to have to recognize balls and strikes, but also learn what he can actually hit. It's possible this will occur, and Arias will be a star if it does, but I think an Orlando Arcia trajectory -- where there are growing pains and frustration amid flashes of spectacle -- is more likely. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>","bzG6c8ZDi_g","sa3004047"

So while I'd love to have found someone who saw his lone outing, I can't, meaning his report is the same as last year's. Torres checked a lot of amateur scouting boxes -- the body, athleticism, stuff, and makeup were all lauded -- and he was a model-friendly prospect due to his age, so while issues with fastball command caused some clubs to project him in relief, he was still a clear top two round talent. Perhaps Torres' fastball command is behind because as a cold-weather amateur prospect, he hasn't pitched all that much. He only threw around 40 innings during his senior spring, and bad suburban high school hitters in New York couldn't catch his fastball. As a result, Torres had little cause to use his changeup during varsity play -- some national evaluators would go whole starts without seeing it -- but it flashed 55 or 60 during his showcase summer and was easy to dream on. 
Perhaps the most striking aspect of Torres' post-draft performance was how regularly he located his slider down and to his glove side. He has mid-rotation components if you're willing to dream based on his athleticism, age, and geographic background, even coming off of a 2019 surgery that, combined with COVID, caused Torres to miss nearly two seasons. <em>(Fall Instructional League...sort of)</em>","oQt2oGijG8Q","sa3008329"

That sentiment was again trumpeted by scouts who saw the huge Cleveland Instructional League contingent in Arizona in the Fall. (You should notice that group has begun to striate throughout the system rather than be grouped together.) Martinez is a bit tightly wound but has the requisite footwork, hands, actions, and arm strength to play shortstop. I think it's possible the lack of bend/flexibility becomes more evident as he adds muscle, which may push him to center field. What's most exciting about Martinez, though, is how advanced and potent both of his swings are for a teenage switch-hitter. He's a shorter-levered guy, so both cuts are relatively short, which helps aid his bat-to-ball ability. The wrists drive what is currently doubles power (because of his speed, there are some triples too), both in raw pop and approach. He has a pull-oriented approach as a righty hitter, and while Martinez can lift balls down-and-in as a lefty, his swing is mostly geared for all-fields line drive contact from that side. 
This hitting style and Martinez's relatively modest physical projection (he's already a pretty ripped 6-feet) make me think the ultimate home run totals will be low but that he will still slug. He has catalytic qualities on offense and a chance to play a premium defensive position. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3008762"

Now two inches taller then when he signed, Hentges is a huge-framed 6-foot-8, comes from a cold-weather location (he's not even the most famous Sam Hentges from Minnesota, as another is a hockey prospect for the Wild), played both ways as an amateur, and lost a year of development to surgery. That he's still raw at age 24 really isn't all that surprising, nor do I find it particularly concerning, though admittedly some of that confidence comes from knowing how hard Hentges was throwing in his big league outings this spring before the shutdown. In those brief outings, Hentges was living in the 96-99 range after sitting 92 (peaking at 96) last year. Cleveland did not baby his innings after he returned from TJ and perhaps 2019 was a bit of a stuff hangover year for him. If he holds this new velo, even if he only does so out of the bullpen, that kind of fastball and Hentges' breaking ball are enough to make him a big time relief piece. He has crude changeup feel and it seemed to be a focus for him during his spring outings. There's still a chance that comes along (remember, this guy has all the late bloomer traits) and Hentges can start, but the (healthy) floor of a lefty reliever who throws as hard as he does is still exciting even if he can't. <em>(Alternate site)</em>",,"18548"

A minimalistic swing enables him to make high rates of contact, while the strength in Miller’s hands generates doubles power. It’s not an exciting, athletic style of hitting but on an inoffensive, fundamentally sound defensive shortstop, it’s a pretty interesting skillset. Barring a significant swing change, Miller’s offensive output will likely cap his ceiling near the 45 FV range, but for a third round pick who moves quickly, that’s a great outcome. 
Miller is arguably polished enough to play in the big leagues in 2021, and with the club's shortstop and first basemen struggling to hit early on, he may need to. If Cleveland ends up with a one-year stopgap, Miller doesn’t have to be put on the 40-man until December of next year, so even though he’s a polished hitter with upper-level experience and could feasibly be called upon to provide above-replacement-level reps in the event that Cleveland’s middle infield is beset by injury, he doesn’t have to occupy a valuable 40-man spot until it is absolutely necessary. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>","vTrfrO-oxJ8","24655"

But based on scouts' looks in the Fall, Vargas' arm action has shortened up (the shift looks similar to Lucas Giolito's) and though I don't consider it likely yet, he's increased his chances of remaining a starter in the eyes of the industry. For the last couple of years, Vargas has been electric at times and maddening at others. I saw him up to 101 on the backfields in 2018 when his outings were between two and four innings in length, then he pitched at mostly 93-97 as a more traditional starter in 2019. During both years, Vargas' command was very spotty. And despite the velocity, he only generated a 7% swinging strike rate with the heater because it has tailing/sinker shape more adept at inducing weak contact than swings and misses. For him to have a real impact heater, I thought Vargas would need to move to the bullpen where he could sit 97-plus the whole time and rely on sheer velocity to miss bats, but now that his arm action has changed that may not be the case. The alteration may have an impact on literally everything about him -- his breaking ball quality, his command, his fastball shape -- and so far it seems to have already improved the demarcation between his two- and four-seamers. We won't truly know until Vargas starts pitching in actual games, but it's instructive that Cleveland added him to their 40-man rather than Luis Oviedo, who had similar issues and was also given a shorter arm action before the club lost him in the Rule 5 draft. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em>","fu527xI4SS0","sa3007467"

Johnson will come to spring training poised to compete with Bradley Zimmer, Jake Bauers, Josh Naylor and perhaps Nolan Jones for corner outfield starts against right-handed pitching. He is as tooled-up as any of those players, so gifted that at various points during his minor league career, some scouts and front office personnel have projected him (he was drafted by Washington and traded for Jefry Rodriguez) as an everyday player. The loudest of those tools is Johnson's arm strength, followed by his speed and then, to a lesser extent, above-average raw power that manifests as doubles in games because his swing really only enables home run power to his pull side. Johnson has a career .284/.344/.460 line in the minors and has never produced a batting line below league average as a pro. So given the tools and performance, why isn't he higher on this list? I think big league arms will be able to pitch to him in a way that limits his power output below the corner outfield average and that Johnson's relative lack of defensive instincts make him more of a fit in right field than in center. At one point Johnson was so raw as a hitter that some scouts wanted to see him on the mound, leading me to I hope there would be late development in some of these areas, but now that Johnson is 25, I think he's likely to settle in as a platoon bat. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>","_vyB942sM98","19643"

It behooves Cantillo to add power to his breaking ball as well.

His cutting fastball sat around 99 mph and touched 102.7 during that stretch. He looked like a huge steal for Texas, which pilfered him from San Diego, straight up, for Brett Nicholas. When Clase was announced as the PTBNL for Nicholas in May of '18, he hadn't yet pitched that year. By that Fall he was sitting in the upper-90s with natural cut. His 40-man timeline and relative inexperience were likely part of why San Diego was willing to move him. Cleveland acquired him from Texas as part of the Corey Kluber trade the following offseason. He still hasn't thrown a pitch for a Cleveland affiliate. <em>(Fall Instructional League, LIDOM)</em>","SvtUnSGGEK4","21032"

But Curry’s performance has been dazzling and he had a 38-to-4 strikeout-to-walk ratio across five starts. Drafted in 2019, Curry’s first affiliated games came in 2021 because he dealt with shoulder inflammation in his draft year. He appears to be getting down the mound a little but better now than while at Tech, but otherwise he appears unchanged. His vertical arm slot creates angle and carry on a fastball that plays well at the letters even though it’s in the low-90s (Curry was 89-92 in college, has been more 91-94 this year), and his arm slot helps create vertical action on both of Curry’s breaking balls. He has a backend/spot start vibe right now.",,"sa3014790"

Hammer's lack of breaking ball, will be glad to know that Robert Broom has a sweeping slider. Like most low-slot relievers, he has a tailing fastball and slider combination that relies on deception and location to succeed. So far, Broom's has. He owns a career 0.90 ERA in 90 innings up through Double-A and he projects as a ""look"" reliever. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em>","bGpgh0siZiU","sa3007235"

He may end up looking at little different next year, but he had been a low leverage long relief prospect because of his repertoire depth, unable to start due to a lack of athleticism and command. <em>(Alternate site)</em>",,"sa738902"

Because he's of the right/right variety, he'll need to hit and hit for power with annual statistical evidence of his proficiency to continue to stay on the prospect radar. Ordinarily I'll have players like this, who are still far from the majors, in the Honorable Mention section of the list, but in Noel's case the top end of his exit velocities are pretty ridiculous for his age. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3005579"
