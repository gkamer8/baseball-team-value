After looking uncharacteristically mistake-prone during the 2019 Fall League, he was the Dominican Winter League's best infield defender in 2020 and should be a plus big league defender at shortstop. While he isn't as deft and precise with the barrel, Peña's swing shares some common rotational elements with fellow Astro Yuli Gurriel. Peña can pull his hands in and get the fat part of the bat on pitches on the inner half, which should enable him to hit 12 to 15 annual pull shots, maybe a couple more because of the Crawford Boxes in Houston. But the profile foundation here is Peña's on-base ability and plus glove at a premium position. He's 23 and hasn't played above A-ball, but is still a pretty stable prospect, in part thanks to his coming of age in LIDOM. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League, LIDOM)</em>","YRrhsdBsxBo","sa876320"

He was often up to 99 at the alt site and sat in the mid-90s during instructs while incorporating a good slider and a rebooted curveball (Brown shelved it in college but it has now been reintroduced in pro ball, and is already better than the slider). Both breaking balls have impact potential. There are some similarities with the way Walker Buehler's stuff changed when he first returned from Tommy John. Brown had a long layoff (though it was because of the pandemic rather than a TJ) and returned with more velo and two good breaking balls rather than just one. 
Brown's uptick in stuff has coincided with a change in his physicality, as he's clearly taking advantage of pro strength programs and facilities (remember, this guy comes out of a Division II school). The change in his physique lends credence to the uptick in stuff, though there's still relief risk here because we haven't seen Brown hold it for a whole season as a starter and he was wild during his brief 2021 big league spring training work. He has a chance to take yet another leap in 2021, especially in an org that is very good at developing pitchers. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3010571"

He was a Pick to Click after the 2019 season in anticipation of him exploding when he returned from rehab, but because of COVID, he didn't pitch until the fall, only returning for 2020 instructs. Scouts who have covered Houston the last couple of years count Solis among the most talented pitchers in the org and think he has as much upside as guys like Forrest Whitley and Bryan Abreu, if not more. He came out during 2021 spring training sitting 93-97 and during the course of four total innings against big leaguers, garnered at least one swing-and-miss with each of his pitches. He also struggled badly with his mechanical consistency and command, and the Mets varsity lineup shelled him. But remember that Solis is still just a 21-year-old who has barely pitched the last two years. If you line up his broad strokes age/stuff quality/relief-risk profile, it lines up pretty closely to LSU prospect Jaden Hill, who entered the 2021 season as a likely top 10 draft pick (he recently blew out). Solis should be close to a healthy Hill on the FV continuum. 
In addition to the mid-90s heat with vertical action, Solis has a power pitcher's overhand curveball to go with a firm, upper-80s slider and changeup. The movement he creates on the slider and changeup is mediocre-looking (note also that his 2021 spring spin rates, per Savant, were below my sourced numbers from 2018) but their shapes deviate enough from his fastball/curveball combo that they play well when located, which doesn't happen regularly yet. The fastball/curveball, meanwhile, have more margin for error due to sheer nastiness. While Solis has filled out during the last couple of years, his lower half is still weak, which impacts his delivery's consistency and his command. If the command piece can be ironed out, Solis has a mid-rotation future. If not, it lies in high-leverage relief. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3003037"

His mobility and plus-plus arm make him a potential impact defender there, and he may end up playing other positions, too. The Astros gave him some reps in the outfield after he signed in 2019, and Lee had amateur experience at several infield positions. He's currently catching on one knee, with his hands working from the ground up as he tries to frame fastballs at the bottom of the zone. While one-knee'd catching can create problems for some guys as they exit their crouch to throw, it's not a problem for Lee, who explodes out of his stance and maintains sound footwork that helps enable arm accuracy. 
He doesn't have a long track record with the bat, however. Yes, Lee hit .320/.420/.626 as a junior at Cal but he didn't perform anywhere near that level as an underclassman and hasn't really had an opportunity to reinforce that line in pro ball because the pandemic washed away what would have been his first full season. Pro scouts who saw him in 2019 after the draft thought his swing was long, sweeping downward in an unimpactful way, and also thought he struggled to recognize breaking balls. His 2020 instructs and 2021 spring training looks were much stronger than that, though, which seems to have coincided with a change to Lee's swing. He's eliminated a big leg kick and simplified his footwork. His rare physical ability combined with the low industry inventory at the catcher position makes him a potential everyday player if the swing change helps make him an even average all-around offensive player. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em> ",,"sa3010034"

He's now a lock to remain a starter and will likely play an integral role in Houston's rotation going forward. During the course of a start, he'll typically sit in the 90-94 range and touch as high as 96 while working an awful lot to his glove side with the heater and his two very distinct breaking balls. Both Garcia's slider/cutter and curveball are average, though his slider has a little more lateral movement than it did in 2020, so maybe that pitch is above now. It's his tailing mid-80s changeup that has the nastiest action, and the best chance to finish big league hitters. 
Garcia was a 32% strikeout, 11% walk rate guy in the minors, including his most recent full season in 2019, the only time in his pro career he's exceeded 100 innings. He no longer looks like the sort of pitcher who'll produce peripherals like that over a full season and I'd expect both of those rate stats to fall. The lack of a short- and long-term workload track record and the leap Garcia might be asked to make in a rotation coming off a short 2020 create some extra volatility here, but Garcia's arm action is so loose and his lower half is so robust and strong that it might be less of an issue for him than it would be for others.

His complete lack of fastball control forces him to work with those breaking balls early in counts, which impacts hitters' willingness to offer at them later in at-bats as they've already seen a couple. Houston had him semi-stretched out as a starter during 2021 spring training but he's almost certain to wind up in single-inning relief, where he could become a closer. It's more likely he becomes a righty version of José Alvarado, providing viral GIF fodder at times while raising the blood pressure of Astros fans at others. <em>(Alternate site)</em>",,"16609"

Until 2021 Spring Training, the last action Leon saw was during the 2018-19 Cuban National Series, in which he homered 15 times in 30 games before dealing with an oblique injury. He was cleared to sign last December but an oblique injury moved back his workout. When it was finally held, teams got a text on the way there saying that Leon had a deal with Houston already done.  The shoulder is healthy and with his power, elite arm strength, and incredible bat speed from the right side, Leon is the sort of player who would have prompted teams to burst through their bonus pool when they weren't hard-capped. The success rate of Cuban hitters, especially ones who have had a long time away from baseball during their relocation process and pre-eligibility period, is highly variable, but Leon looked pretty comfortable against big league pitching during 2021 Spring Training, and he squared good velocity several times. The Astros plan on experimenting with him at shortstop and in center field. He's a very interesting and talented prospect with a chance to be an impact player. <em>(International signee)</em>",,

He's also gotten considerably stronger since high school even though he didn't have an overtly projectable frame, and while he may not have gargantuan power, he might outproduce his raw power grade in games because his feel for contact is so good. He went to the alt site very late in the year then had an impressive instructs, where he not only raked but also posted plus run times. The same source who collected those plus run times has a left field projection on Barber due to a lack of arm strength, and his hit tool will likely need to help amplify the power for him to profile as a true everyday player there. I have a slightly higher degree of confidence in Barber doing this since he's a strong, short-levered hitter and those guys' hit tools seem to max out more consistently than their longer counterparts. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em> ",,"sa3010696"

By the time he had finished his first full season in pro ball, Solomon had started as many games as he had his entire college career while only working about four innings per outing in Houston's piggyback development style. Off to a very fast start in 2019, Solomon blew out and needed Tommy John surgery. Even as he rehabbed over the next two seasons (only returning for 2020 instructs), he was asked about in trades and seemingly continued to hone starter-worthy command during rehab. He looked great during 2021 spring training, sitting 93-94 with carry and working with a plus changeup. Both of Solomon's breaking balls are about average and have glove-side utility. What kind of workload he'll be able to sustain remains a question, since not only is Solomon coming off a TJ but he's also never thrown more than 100 innings in a season when healthy.

His fastball plays well at the top of the zone even though it isn't all that hard, and really hasn't been since 2018. His curveball is the headliner, though. It's a gorgeous, old-school 12-to-6 yakker that freezes hitters. He also has a cutter/slider and a changeup, the latter of which shows flashes of bat-missing movement.

He transformed from a soft-bodied pitchability high schooler to a svelte, five-pitch, fire-breathing dragon in the span of about 18 months, then had a 2018 stimulant suspension plus lat and oblique issues before 2019 brought shoulder fatigue, control problems, and what looked like a conditioning regression. Depending on the day, his fastball velocity was anywhere from 91 to 98 at the 2020 alternate site, and he seemed a distant thought even at the end of the year when the big club was clamoring for pitching. 
Spring of 2021 arrived and by mid-March, Whitley needed Tommy John. If there's a silver lining, it's that it may gives him the opportunity to rebuild and fine tune his body, which is common for TJ rehab guys. It's possible we'll once again see Whitley sitting 94-97 with a bevy of elite secondary offerings, but I'd be surprised if he's able to do that year after year for a half decade based on how unfortunate his health-related track record has been so far. <em>(Alternate site)</em>","5krfMUxyV_M","sa917930"

Like Lara, Nova has quickly filled out and morphed from a swing-happy middle infielder with power projection into one with more of a corner look and considerable present power. He's so much bigger and stronger now that some scouts who saw him both last fall and this spring think his ultimate destination may be first base, and that his body has already begun to look like that of late-career Hanley Ramirez. Nova's plus-plus arm may enable him to hide some of what project to be lateral range deficiencies, and he could still end up at third base or playing a Moustakas-y second. 
It puts more pressure on him to develop a better approach than his current, over-aggressive version. Remember though that Nova has performed on paper despite his approach, including a nearly average line as a 19-year-old in the Midwest League back in 2019 that featured 25 extra-base hits in just 75 games. Unlike the Gilbert Lara/Brewers situation, the club here thought highly enough of Nova to put him on their 40-man.

At the time, Dubin was listed at a dandelionesque 155 pounds but has since climbed up over 170, albeit without seeing any more velo. It might help quell some concerns about his size and durability, though. Dubin was once again mostly 93-96 this spring, folding in an upper-80s slider and mid-80s curveball.

In the 2019 draft, Brewer was an outfielder for the College World Series finalist and arguably had the best raw tools in the draft. But he lasted until the back of the third round due to his rawness at the plate, underlined by his 56 strikeouts to 24 walks. 
At the plate, Brewer's pitch selection is below average and his swing can get long, so the prototypical profile of the below average contact platoon center fielder, like a Jake Marisnick, is the reasonable upside since Brewer is already 23, going on 24, and has barely played during the last two years because of a toe injury, the pandemic, and a knee surgery. <em>(Injury rehab)</em>",,"sa3011737"

He looked a little less athletic and loose in his first 2020 start but it was chilly (in the 50s); he showed no real velo uptick and never got a chance to.

That's still nothing to sneeze at, as Rodriguez's backspinning heater plays a little bit above its velocity due to its carry at the top of the zone.

He sat 97 and touched 100 in 2019, and both his breaking ball and changeup are potential swing-and-miss offerings. He may have been less likely to stick with the Angels than he would have been elsewhere given their desire to compete immediately rather than deal with potential wildness (as compared to Yohan Ramirez the year before, who went to a team willing to put up with it to roster him long-term). He is not on the 40-man but may still make a 2021 debut if the club deals with a rash of injuries. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em> ",,"sa3003090"

He also has a breaking ball that spins in excess of 2,800 rpm. A scout who saw him during the fall of 2020 thinks I'm overstating how messy the delivery is (they described it as ""clean""), so maybe something there has changed for the better.

First, the visual evaluations of him continue to underscore his lack of athleticism. Second, the pitch data that originally put me onto him in a big way (his fastball had among the most vertical movement in the 2019 minors) was likely tainted by a miscalibrated TrackMan unit. A front office person told me over the phone, ""Some of these 2019 readings aren't humanly possible."" But hey, Macuare still has relatively advanced feel for pitching, especially when he's working with his curveball. He's more likely to end up as a depth starter rather than a consistent backend guy. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3003039"

He was re-deployed at a short season affiliate later in the summer. He still ended up walking more than a batter per inning, and the 2020 instructs reports indicate that he remains quite wild.

He doesn't throw all that hard, only sitting 90-93, and Conine actually sat more in the upper-80s during his 2021 spring debut. But he pounds the zone with his fastball and even though it isn't that hard, it still generated a 16% swinging strike rate in the minors in 2019 thanks to Conine's command and his heater's plus vertical movement. He also locates his (below-average) slider very consistently and has a great changeup. The velocity piece of the puzzle feels a little bit precarious based on the early spring look, but otherwise Conine is big league rotation depth right now. <em>(Alternate site)</em>",,"sa3008024"
