He wields one of the deepest repertoires in all of the minors and, though the elite-looking changeup he showed during the 2018 Fall League was not present in 2019, all of his stuff is still above-average or better, both visually and on paper. 
The strike-throwing hiccup isn't great, but Whitley clearly knows where his stuff plays best (fastballs up, the cutter and slider to his glove side, and the curveball beneath the zone -- a well-designed mix nearly ubiquitous in this system) and he works in those locations pretty loosely. Inefficiency might limit Whitley's inning totals, but it's unlikely to prevent him from starting. Ideally, Whitley shows up to camp in better shape than he appeared to be in during the Fall League; he underwent a much more drastic athletic metamorphosis in high school (which coincided with his pre-draft velo spike), so it seems very possible. The top of a rotation ceiling that seemed possible a year ago would now require a bit of a bounce back in stuff and a quantum control/command leap. That seems unlikely, but a mid-rotation/All-Star ceiling still exists.","5krfMUxyV_M","sa917930"

He sat 89-93 in 2018, then found a few more ticks of velo and a second breaking ball in 2019, all while retaining the command and change. Both breaking balls will play because of where Urquidy locates them (the slider, especially, needs to miss away from hitters), and his changeup action works against both handed hitters, so he's a promising rotation piece who we project as a 2.5 WAR-ish starter.","DyW5jAVSmO4","18413"

Running is simple to evaluate using home to first times, but there's even disagreement over Toro in this area. But let's start with the most important stuff: the offense. Toro is short-levered and tightly-wound, not the loose, rotational athlete most scouts like. But he muscles balls into both gaps and has solid barrel control, enough to spoil tough pitches and grind out tough at-bats. It's a pretty well-rounded contact/doubles power/OBP profile even though Toro presents an atypical look. 
The same is true of Toro's defense. When he has the time to really step into a throw, he uncorks rockets, but he's not the kind of athlete who can make strong throws in tough situations. He's okay at third base, but there are teams and individual scouts who prefer him at either first or in the outfield corners, and some are really intrigued by the latter possibility because of Toro's long speed. He's not a graceful runner, but he can really move once he gets going and his swing has a natural jailbreak, so he's fast to first. A diverse defensive role seems logical considering how crowded Houston's 1B/3B situation is, unless Toro gets traded. He has a shot to be an average everyday player if he gets an opportunity, but otherwise should play a valuable, switch-hitting corner role.","yd1p1EpIUrE","19844"

He takes questionable at-bats, but the frame/power projection and likelihood that Nova stay on the dirt, probably on the left side of the infield, give him a shot to be an impact regular. Despite an Epicurean approach, Nova has a three-year track record of statistical success, including a nearly average line as a 19-year-old in the Midwest League last year, which featured 25 extra-base hits in just 75 games.",,"sa3003195"

His complete lack of fastball control forces him to work with those breaking balls early in counts, which impacts hitters' willingness to offer at them later in at-bats as they've already seen a couple.

He manipulates the shape of his breaking balls, pitches backward, and will double and triple up on his changeup when he's behind in the count, all in an attempt to get to two strikes so he can try to sneak his fastball past hitters. And he does. Javier has fringe velocity but his fastball garners swings and misses more than 17% of the time. Even though he struggles with walks, his career WHIP is just a shade over 1.00 because hitters can't touch his stuff. It may be in a 90 or 100 inning bullpen role, but Javier projects to be a core piece of Houston's staff.",,"sa874816"

He had some rashes of wildness early in the year, but over the final two months of the summer, Bielak was his characteristic, strike-throwing self. He can pitch backwards and consistently locates both of his breaking balls to his glove side; Bielak often sets up one with the other. There's a starter's repertoire depth and pitch quality here, along with a starter's command and good raw spin, and he performed against Triple-A hitters late in the season. He's a high-probability No. 4/5 starter.","AKReu-6lQvg","sa915815"

Teams with draft models that more evenly weight multiple seasons weren't on Lee as much before the draft because he didn't perform like that as an underclassman. Lee didn't catch much pro-quality stuff at Cal, so that part of his skillset remains somewhat unclear, but we think he's athletic enough to improve if it's an issue initially. He looked ground down last summer after he signed, and was less balanced at the plate.

Among the non-Top 100 types of arms in this system, he not only has one of the better chances of remaining a starter but also has the best stuff among those who do, led by a plus-flashing curveball that he has great feel for locating. Solis also has a great arm for a 19-year-old, and may still throw harder as he matures, with his fastball already sitting in the viable low-to-mid 90s. There's some changeup feel here, too, and teams think Solis has mid-rotation ceiling so long as his command continues to progress. 
The Astros will need to make a Rule 5 protection 40-man decision on him after the 2020 season, a decision that will be made easier if Solis hits the ground running after rehab.",,"sa3003037"

We think he'll continue to hit for doubles power while playing a terrific shortstop.

He began the season in Extended before joining Low-A Quad Cities in a piggyback role, usually working three or four innings per outing, mostly with his monster fastball and power breaking ball, from which he adds and subtracts when he's trying to get back into counts. The longer arm action, mostly two-pitch mix, fringe control and age/level/40-man timeline funnel Rivera toward the bullpen, and he might be very scary if his heater has another gear in single innings.",,"sa3003090"

He is arguably the best athlete in this system, and it's incredible that he's able to stay balanced over his landing leg despite taking a gargantuan, max-effort stride toward home. So deep is the bend in Paredes' landing leg, so low to the ground is he at release, that his fastballs approach hitters at a very flat angle that they seem to struggle with. He throws really hard, up to 99 with explosive life, and mixes in several semi-consistent secondary offerings of varying shape and quality.

His fastball plays well at the top of the zone. Even last year, when he wasn't throwing quite as hard as the year before, Ivey's fastball hummed past upper-level hitters. His curveball is the headliner, though. It's a gorgeous, old-school, 12-to-6 yakker that freezes hitters. He also has a cutter/slider and a changeup, the latter of which shows flashes of bat-missing movement. Unless the mid-90s heat comes back, we prefer Ivey in a multi-inning relief role, but he'll probably be given at least one more year of starts just to see what happens since he doesn't have to be on the 40 until next winter.",,"sa3004574"

He was draft eligible in 2018 at Lincoln Trail JC in Illinois and went undrafted, but emerged in his season at Michigan due to his huge tools: solid average raw power, plus-plus speed, plus arm strength and good instincts on the bases.

He looked a little less athletic and loose in his first 2020 start but it was chilly, in the 50s. He showed no real velo uptick.

Brandon Crawford and Dansby Swanson are some of the more notable successes, Jordy Mercer is a middle tier outcome, and Connor Kaiser (Pirates) along with Connor Walsh (Ole Miss) are two in-progress candidates along with Kessinger. Kessinger also has big league bloodlines: his grandfather (Don) played 16 seasons in the big leagues in the 1960s and 70s, his father (Kevin) played a summer of pro ball in 1992, and his uncle (Keith) got a big league cup of coffee in 1993.
Grae stood out on the summer showcase circuit in high school as a glove-first athlete with the tools to succeed offensively but middling performance against top pitching; that mostly held through his three years at Ole Miss, though he made solid progress. Kessinger's approach steadily improved and he got to more of his power, leading to a pro debut at age 21 spent mostly in Low-A, where he performed almost as well as he did in college. His swing complexity and effort were reduced in college to make more contact, and he's a swing change candidate in pro ball, as this type of hitter can benefit from mechanics that free up his athleticism. Kessinger was an above average defender in high school but bulked up a bit in college and lost a bit of quickness. Any kind of step forward offensively would give him a big league role of some consequence.",,"sa3010327"
