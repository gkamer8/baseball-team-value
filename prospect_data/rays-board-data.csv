What does it take to draw such significant expectations? Let's first examine the statistical case. Franco has played 175 career games, all at levels well above what is typical for a player his age (he doesn't turn 19 until March). During those games, he's hit .336/.405/.523 with 71 extra-base hits, 20 steals, and more walks than strikeouts. In fact, across two levels in 2019, Low- and Hi-A, Franco not only walked more than he struck out, but walked about <em>twice</em> as much. He has one of the lowest swinging strike rates in the entire minor leagues, and it's possible the power hasn't fully actualized yet because Franco still hits the ball on the ground a lot (48% last year). How about the TrackMan data? Franco's exit velos and hard hit rate are both above big league average, which, again, is ridiculous for a teenager who's playing against competition four and a half years older than he is in the Florida State League. 
Of course, the visual baseball evaluation is also incredible. Franco had one of the best BP sessions at the Futures Game (his was better than Jo Adell, Nolan Jones, and everyone not named Royce Lewis) and the best infield. His hands are a powder keg, accelerating to the point where he can do huge damage, and he doesn't need mechanical length to get there. This is true from both sides of the plate; Franco can't be thwarted by turning him around and forcing him to hit from a weaker side. He might not ever produce big home run totals without a swing change, but it'd be ridiculous to alter this guy's swing considering how elite his performance has been. A scouting director once told me, ""Elite players are elite all the time,"" and that has been true of Franco since he was a young teen. He's been a force of nature offensively, he plays a premium defensive position very well, and my degree of confidence in his ability to do both in perpetuity is high because that's all Franco has ever done.","OsxMtDgMaI0","sa3007033"

He was unusually homer-prone during his big league stretch, something that has never been an issue before even with middling velocity, because McKay's command is so good. I think it's a small sample blip that will regress over more innings, though I did have folks from analytically-inclined teams suggest that I slide McKay down on my overall rankings when I circulated the list for feedback. 
His fastball only sits 90-94 and touches 96, which is pretty average, but McKay keeps it away from the middle of the zone where it can really be hammered and often ties hitters up with it because he locates so well; his swinging strike rate on the heater was close to 17% in the minors, so I think it'll play. His cutter command is arguably even better, and he peppers the glove side of the plate with it at will. Changeup usage was scarce in his big league sample but I think it will be one of the focal points of his repertoire, perhaps usurping the curveball, which has a stronger visual evaluation than it does if you look at the spin data. It's a repertoire/command profile similar to a lot of good lefties (Hyun-Jin Ryu, Mike Minor, Cole Hamels), though most of them are more reliant on the cambio than McKay has been to this point. He may not have the rate stats of the other arms in the 60 FV tier, but I expect he'll make up for all of that with volume because of how efficiently he works.","aCKSVKfZpv0","20186"

He split 2019 between Hi- and Double-A and his walk rate took a bit of a hit at those levels, but otherwise, his on-paper performance was strong, well above league averages (.277/.346/.389 with 48 bags in 61 attempts, and 28 extra-base hits in 100 games). His exit velo data is not great, but it was instructive to watch Brujan in the Fall League next to several other players with similar statistical and defensive profiles who aren't nearly as athletic or as physically projectable as he is. There were lots of other narrowly built infielders of similar age who simply don't have Brujan's musculature (you can see his lats through his jersey) or explosiveness. I think there's room for mass even though Brujan is short, and that he'll continue to harness his hellacious cut, which, based on his contact rates, he already has abnormal control over. I watched Brujan swing so hard that he'd corkscrew himself to the ground, only to pop back up like a Russian folk dancer. There are scouts who think he can play shortstop, but I think the arm is a little light for that and that instead, he'll be a plus-plus defender at second base or perhaps play a multi-positional, up-the-middle role. You have to bet on him growing into more pop to get there, but I think Brujan's going to be a star.","UBXDU4EcKOo","sa872786"

He was a power/speed prep bat without a clear position, but most of the amateur half of the industry assumed he'd be able to play center field if not shortstop or third base, where he played in high school. He quickly moved to the outfield and has played almost exclusively in center since 2017. He isn't great there, but most of Lowe's other abilities have been slow to develop, so it's possible the feel for the position will come eventually. For instance, Lowe has power but has been strikeout prone since his prep days. But once he started playing pro games and generating data, it became clear that, despite the whiffs, he had a great idea of the strike zone. The raw power didn't really show up in games until Lowe's batted ball profile began to shift in 2018. His groundball rates were in the mid-40% range until that year but slowly began shifting downward, then Lowe had a breakout statistical 2019 as a 21-year-old at Double-A. 
He's always going to strike out, but he's also probably going to keep walking a lot, especially now that the power is a real threat. It's pretty important that he stay in center field to take some pressure off of the hit tool. If he can do that, he'll be an everyday player.","FpeotjI5qYU","sa917926"

He had a TJ, then a nerve issue during rehab, then fractured his elbow in the bullpen just after last year's draft. The sequence of events that has befallen Honeywell is relatively unprecedented, and while he was a 55 or 60 FV arm at peak, his future is now in doubt. And that's a bummer, because he's a lot of fun to watch pitch. 
A creative sequencer, Honeywell's deep, unique repertoire is unlike any other pitcher in the minors. Though his fastball touches 98, his stuff is so diverse that he never has to pitch off of it. He can lob his curveball in for strikes, induce weak contact early in counts by throwing a cutter when hitters are sitting fastball, and he'll double and triple up on the changeup. What you see listed in Honeywell's tool grades as a splitter is actually a screwball. It wobbles home in the 79-82 mph range, while his true changeup is usually a little harder than that. The screwgie is more than a gimmick and can miss bats, though it’s best in moderation because it's a little easier to identify out of his hand, and hitters are able to recognize it after seeing it multiple times in the same at-bat.","JC3Vetq_eAA","sa828706"

His quality of contact is very good, he's a plus corner outfielder who can pass in center field, and he's a great baserunner, as well as an intense, high-effort player who pro scouts love watching -- Arozarena once turned a routine pop-up into a triple because he sprinted full-tilt out of the box while the infielders miscommunicated.","4VdQSUbzmz8","19290"

While the amateur side lacked conviction in his defensive fit at shortstop, the pro side thinks Walls' first step, internal clock, and situational awareness, combined with suitable foot speed, actions, and arm strength, not only make him viable at short, but actually quite good. 
Offensively, Walls is a switch-hitter with great feel for the strike zone and for squaring balls all over it. He's kinda stiff and really doesn't have much power, instead punching a lot of liner singles over the heads of infielders. It's not a sexy skillset but it is a great general profile -- a switch-hitting shortstop with on base skills -- with enough physical tools to compete with big leaguers.

That window was closed due to the pandemic, and so teams' opinions of Bitsko are going to be driven by what they saw last year (he was 92-96 in front of heavy-hitting eyeballs at East Coast Pro) and, in the case of some teams, what they saw in the bullpen just before the shutdown. In both instances, Bitsko's arm strength, curveball, and touch-and-feel command were on par with first round high school arms, though that demographic's track record is scary and being devalued by teams. That, combined with the possibility that some teams won't be comfortable taking a player they've barely seen, makes Bitsko's stock pretty volatile.","jTQS49gZv44",

In the first start of his draft year, he hit 100 mph and flashed above average secondary stuff, which put him among the draft's top prospects right out of the gate. But things started to unravel from there. A finger injury, bad weather, fluctuating stuff, frustrating control, and questions about his maturity all contributed to a draft-day tumble to pick No. 31 and the hometown Rays. 
A year later, those concerns seem trite. A more consistent, balanced delivery enabled McClanahan to throw more strikes and he absolutely carved A-ball. He got especially hot over a nine-game stretch at Hi-A, where he walked just eight over 49 innings. I still have McClanahan evaluated as a reliever. These are improvements compared to what McClanahan was doing later in 2018, yes, but I still think the command and third pitch fall short of what's acceptable for a starter. But I also think the fastball/breaking ball combo fits like a glove in a high-leverage relief role.","ntk-CU1Bo6A","sa3008547"

He'll undoubtedly hit some sort of decline phase during that window, but he's also someone our readers would like to know about. I have him here purely with the role in mind, which I think is the bigger half of the platoon LF/DH, a 1.5 to 2 WAR sort of player during the life of his deal. Tsutsugo was a .282/.382/.528 career hitter in Japan, averaged 34 homers over his last four years there, and had a 13% career walk rate in NPB. He has all-fields power created by a swing I’ve compared to Eddie Rosario’s. Multiple sources have confirmed to me that Tsutsugo averaged an exit velocity of 92 mph (108 mph max) last year in Japan, which would rank among the top 30 big leaguers, but of course the level and type of pitching he’ll see now is going to be different. Kaz Matsui and Kosuke Fukudome each had comparable peak power numbers before they came over but Matsui didn’t have Tsutsugo’s ball/strike recognition, and Fukudome was a little bit older and didn’t have this kind of physicality. 
In addition to regular DH duty, Tsutsugo seems like an obvious platoon partner for Hunter Renfroe in one of the two corner outfield spots. The Rays gave him some time at third base this spring, but he didn't look great there and he hasn't played the infield regularly since 2014; the notes I have from pro/international scouts and executives from before he signed indicate that he’s not athletically capable of handling the hot corner. Yandy Díaz isn’t good there either (he used to be, but he’s just too big and stiff now), but still played third situationally, so perhaps Tsutsugo can be hidden there, even if it’s just for a few innings at a time.",,"27459"

He also improved enough defensively to keep the shortstop projection alive. It was enough for him to be in teams' mix in the comp round zip code, and he was drafted 31st overall by the Rays. 
A year and a half later, Jones remains the same sort of player. He struggled during Extended, but had a strong summer in the Penn League, a pretty conservative assignment. Jones has everyday outs. Even if he doesn't stay at short, he's going to play up the middle, and so long as he's getting to the power he has a shot to play everyday.

He did most of his damage with the fastball, which is puzzling because Ryan's heater doesn't seem remarkable in any way, even in light of the pitch data I've sourced. He'll touch 96, but sits mostly 90-94 with average underlying components like spin, z-break, and extension. Despite that, Ryan is getting a lot of swinging strikes in the zone with his fastball. Like, a lot, a lot. His arm stroke is curt, and the ball just kind of jumps on hitters, so perhaps that's contributing to its effectiveness, but it's not such a unique look as to satisfactorily explain this level of dominance. 
The supporting cast -- a low-70s rainbow curveball, the occasional cutter or changeup -- is only okay, so vanilla that Ryan just pumps his fastball in, pitch after pitch. He used it 73% of the time last year. There's no precedent for that level of usage among big league starters. Based on the way the fastball plays (the whiff rates indicate it's an elite pitch, but based on how big league hitters dealt with it this spring, I have a 60 on it) and Ryan's command, I have him in as a strike-throwing No. 4/5 starter.",,"sa3007584"

It's not even clear whether Pie is going to stay on the infield. He runs well enough that center field is a possibility if his actions don't improve, and he has the arm to play short or third if they do. 
Even if Pie tumbles down the defensive spectrum, it likely means he's grown into substantial raw power, enough to profile at any position. His current tool grade projections indicate what I think things will look like if his frame develops such that it allows him to stay at shortstop, but I think it's going to take a long time before Pie's skillset truly comes into focus.","pROw9MwMoSw","sa3008754"

He has big power and breathtaking arm strength, but there are questions about the approach (which might impede the power) and his defensive ability, specifically the receiving. After three straight years of big time slugging performance, Hernandez's output dipped in the pitcher-friendly Florida State League. Some of this was due to the hitting environment; some of it was due to more advanced pitchers understanding how to attack him to limit damage. Hernandez's swing cuts down through the typical hitting zone and his power is out in front when his swing starts to lift, which makes his point of impact of paramount importance to his power production. There are mixed opinions as to whether this is correctable. While what matters for catchers defensively may soon change, the combo of approach and swing issues have caused me to become more tepid on Hernandez's offensive future.

Goss' fastball has tough-to-square arm side tail created by his three-quarters arm slot, and its movement pairs well with his fairly advanced changeup, which seemed to evolve into a firm, mid-80s split once he was in pro ball. 
He has worked with two breaking balls in the past, both of which reside in the low-80s and have enough depth and movement to be considered future average pitches in a vacuum, but they lack raw spin and were consolidated after he signed. They may play better against righties if Goss' delivery proves tough for them to parse.

Scouts who saw Frank in pro ball after the Rays popped him in the second round see a slightly lesser version of Taylor Walls, another under-tooled Rays middle infielder with lots of feel. Frank is seen as more of a second baseman going forward and his 45 raw power, 50 speed, and 50 defense still aren't loud, but his ability to hit, take a good at-bat, and have advanced feel for the game give him the look of a potential low-end regular who could move quickly through the minors.

His stock and performance peaked in late-March, then dipped closer to the draft when he failed to get through five or more innings in five of his last eight starts. He was sitting 91-95 in 30-pitch outings after he signed, and his slider spin rate spiked once the Rays got hold of him. The pre-draft dip leaves room for questions about his season-long durability, but Johnson was still so new to pitching that expecting him to hold his stuff for five or more innings all spring would have been silly. Assuming that comes (his is a longer arm action, but Johnson is a plus athlete and I think he can repeat it), he has No. 4 starter ceiling.

To possess premium bat speed and face pitching in the 80s but still inside-out home runs suggests that Schnell has been late on subpar stuff, and his deep hand load, which helps create the power, also creates a ton of length back to the ball.

Barring a swing change or feel for lift that develops naturally as he matures, this is likely to be more of a doubles-oriented power profile, but the bat-to-ball skills may carry him to an everyday infield role even if there's no change there.",,"sa3003282"

That includes a 104 wRC+ in a depressed 2019 Southern League, where the average hitter's line was .243/.318/.366. Despite major league-average exit velocities, Fox's contact quality isn't great, and he has an OBP-driven offensive profile thanks to his keen eye for the zone. 
He'd need to be a plus shortstop defender to profile as a low-end regular, and while he has looked like it at times, it hasn't been consistent, and the Rays began moving him all over the infield late last year. As a switch-hitter who's better from the right side (his numbers have been much better as a righty bat the last couple years), I think Fox will play some sort of multi-positional, shorter half of a platoon role while also pinch running. If you think he's a low-end regular at short, then he's a 45 FV, but I think it'll be hard for him to be more than a 1-WAR role player without any impact in the bat.","9De92or9Lp8","sa914200"

Rookie-level stats aren’t a reliable means of evaluation on their own, but in this case, they underscore a surprising level of competence given Mead’s inexperience.

So while Gaston may get stronger as he physically matures, what's more important is the projection of his feel for pitching, which appears to be more natural at a three-quarters arm slot with velocity more in the mid-90s, where his arm action is also more naturally online, than the higher slot where he was throwing harder and wilder. 
Gaston's best pitching performance was as the main event on the mound at the Víctor Víctor Mesa workout in Marlins Park, where the better version of his arm slot, arm action, and control was first seen by a large scouting audience.
