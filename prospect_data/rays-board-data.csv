It's not expected to be a long-term issue, and Franco himself wanted to rest and return to action for Escogido (the left side of los Leones infield would have been him and Vladimir Guerrero Jr.), but the Rays prevented it as a precaution. I suppose there's some chance that this issue, combined with the presence of other good shortstops in the org like Willy Adames and Taylor Walls (assuming either or both aren't traded) creates a heightened chance that Franco debuts in the big leagues as a second baseman, but even if we knew that was going to be the case, he'd still easily be the best prospect in baseball. 
In fact, last year Franco became the first 80 FV prospect of the Future Value era at FanGraphs, the best prospect on the planet, and the best I've evaluated during my tenure here at the site. Recall Franco's statistical track record, which is better than Vladdy's was at the same age and levels: He has played 175 career games, all at levels well above what is typical for a player his age (he doesn't turn 20 until March). During those games, he hit .336/.405/.523 with 71 extra-base hits, 20 steals, and more walks than strikeouts. In fact, across two levels in 2019, Low- and Hi-A, Franco not only walked more than he struck out, but walked about <em>twice</em> as much. He has one of the lowest swinging strike rates in the minor leagues at a paltry 4.8%. Franco's short levers and lightning-quick wrists make it nearly impossible to beat him with velocity, especially on the inner half. He is also especially adept at spoiling well-located back-foot breaking balls, and if you miss with one and catch even part of the zone, he can drop the bat head and yank it out to his pull side. Work away from him and he'll extend his arms and pepper the opposite field gap with line drives, then use his speed to turn lots of those into doubles. He has impressive raw juice in BP, which he shows off because he makes such consistent contact (his 2019 Futures Game BP was better than Jo Adell's and Nolan Jones' even though those guys have bigger raw power), but it's possible Franco's in-game power hasn't fully actualized yet because he still hits the ball on the ground a lot (48% in 2019, with just a 9 degree average launch angle). And yet he's still slugging like a physically mature Quad-A hitter. How about the TrackMan data? Franco's exit velos and hard hit rate (which are on The Board) are both above the big league average, which is ridiculous for a teenager who's playing against competition four and a half years older than he is. 
He might not ever produce huge home run totals without a swing change (someone told me, ""If that's true, then imagine a Michael Brantley-type of hitter who switch-hits and plays shortstop""), but it'd be ridiculous to alter this guy's swing considering how elite his performance has been, and I think the elite bat-to-ball skills will enable him to hit for more game power than his raw.  Franco has been the best player his age on the planet since he was 14 years old. He looks like, and has performed like, a generational talent and annual MVP contender. <em>(Alternate site, LIDOM)</em>","OsxMtDgMaI0","sa3007033"

I think this is a real, relevant change and helped drive his debut season's triple slash line, a star-like .281/.382/.641 in the regular season and God-like .500/.538/1.042 in the playoffs. A pertinent data point here is Arozarena’s max exit velo, which was 109 mph in 2019 and moved up to 113 mph in 2020. This is a measurable change in physical ability, the reason for which is well-publicized and which is supported by a visual evaluation of Arozarena’s physicality. And I’m not too worried about the sudden uptick in his strikeout rate because it not only occurred in a small sample but is way above his career norm of 18.5% (I'm avoiding recency bias), and the circumstances surrounding it (Arozarena rolled out of quarantine bed and faced big league pitching for the longest stretch of his life) are odd. We also got our first glimpse of how opponents are going to pitch to Arozarena now that he's a certified masher, and I think that his walk rate and OBP are both going to take a pretty serious leap. His newfound physique might also bring about a change to his approach to contact (this guy once looked like a leadoff hitter) as he continues to get a feel for what it's like to have this much juice, but I'm not sure how that will manifest on the field. I think the added weight has made him a worse defender and now have a 40 on him in left field, not that it matters. He's likely to anchor the middle of the Rays order for the next half decade. It should be noted that Arozarena was involved in an altercation related to a custody dispute this offseason; he was released from custody after his former partner declined to press charges. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>","4VdQSUbzmz8","19290"

Some of that doubt is the result of his size (I specifically don't have these concerns), while the rest is the result of his sub-par control/command. Indeed Patiño's BB/9 rose as he was promoted to each of his previous four minor league levels, culminating in a gnarly 16.5% walk rate during a small 2020 big league sample. For someone as short as Patiño is, his arm swing is actually quite long, and his tactile feel for release has seemingly regressed as he's gotten more muscular. But remember that this is one of the better on-mound athletes in the minors, who is still only the age of a college prospect, and who hasn't had elite velocity for very long. Since he signed, Patiño has gained about 40 pounds and added about 10 ticks of fastball velocity. More important context: Patiño is a converted infielder who has only been focused on pitching for about five years, and one of those was seriously disrupted by the pandemic. Certainly Patiño needs to find more mechanical consistency and his fastball location needs to move north. Plus, his changeup feel is still quite raw. But if this guy were at LSU or UCLA, we'd be talking about him as the odds-on favorite to go number one overall in this year's draft. I still project Patiño as a multi-time All-Star starter. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>","k11tj7Ee2qs","22815"

How could we have collectively anticipated that he'd transform from a light-hitting speedster shortstop into a multi-positional physical freak with a rare power/speed/patience combination? I submit that Bruján shares all of Marte's pre-breakout traits (and has a lot in common with Ozzie Albies, too) and could take a similar leap in his mid-20s, as he progresses further into physical maturity. Like Marte, Bruján is a top-of-the-scale athlete and one of the most electric in-the-box rotators in all of the minor leagues. There are lots of other players whose measurable height and weight read as ""small"" who simply don't have Bruján's body composition (he's angular, tapered at the waist rather than built like a stick), musculature (you can see his lats through his jersey), or explosiveness. I think he has room to add mass even though he's short, and that he's likely to because he's a dedicated worker, which means some indeterminate amount of power will arrive with time. 
I also think that he'll continue to harness his hellacious swing, which, based on his contact rates, he already has abnormal control over. I've watched Bruján swing so hard that he corkscrewed himself to the ground, only to pop back up like a Russian folk dancer, but even though he swings that hard, he has good feel for contact and ball/strike recognition, enabling him to grind out tough at-bats and walk a bunch. Let's re-examine the statistical case. Bruján split 2019 between Hi- and Double-A and while his walk rate took a bit of a dip at those levels, his on-paper performance was still well above league average (.277/.346/.389 with 48 bags in 61 attempts, and 28 extra-base hits in 100 games) for the Florida State and Southern Leagues. His exit velo data from 2019 is not great, but remember I'm betting on more of that arriving later. There are scouts who think he can play shortstop, but I think the arm is a little light for that and instead think he'll be play a combination of second base and center field. As I've passed around the early iterations of my Top 100 list for industry feedback, most have told me I'm at least a little too high on Bruján, which I think is useful for readers to know, but I'm sticking to my guns on this one because I think he has a chance to be a star. <em>(Alternate site)</em>","UBXDU4EcKOo","sa872786"

From last year: Things may finally be starting to gel for Lowe, who has had tantalizing tools since high school. He was a power/speed prep bat without a clear position, but most of the amateur half of the industry assumed he'd be able to play center field if not shortstop or third base, where he played in high school. He quickly moved to the outfield and has played almost exclusively in center since 2017. He isn't great there, but most of Lowe's other abilities have been slow to develop, so it's possible his feel for the position will come later, too. For instance, Lowe has big all-fields power but has been strikeout prone since his prep days. Once he began playing pro games and generating data, however, it became clear that, despite the whiffs, he had a great idea of the strike zone. The raw power didn't really show up in games until Lowe's batted ball profile began to shift in 2018. His groundball rates were in the mid-40% range until that year but slowly began shifting downward. Then Lowe had a breakout statistical 2019 as a 21-year-old at Double-A. 
He's always going to strike out, but he's also probably going to keep walking a lot, especially now that the power is a real threat. It's pretty important that he stay in center field to take some pressure off of the hit tool. If he can do that, he'll be an everyday player. <em>(Alternate site)</em>","FpeotjI5qYU","sa917926"

Up until this year, it had typically been the in-office analyst types whose Edwards opinions were more tepid, as scouts (especially on the amateur side) loved his speed/contact blend and how hard he played. But his lack of impact contact was, for the first time, noted as a real problem by scouts who saw him in the Fall of 2020. As with Nick Madrigal, Luis Arraez and other players like them, I think hitters with a complete lack of power can still be good everyday players provided that they make a nearly elite amount of contact, and to this point Edwards has. Like Franco, Edwards' 2019 swinging strike rate was just 4.8% (he just doesn't put the ball in play as hard) and his track record of hitting in games extends way back to his underclass high school days. At one point, I thought Edwards could be a slash-and-dash Luis Castillo clone, but he doesn't have the samurai-level feel for contact Castillo did. I still have a high degree of confidence in his bat. All of Edwards' extra-base damage will be done down either baseline, as he'll sneak grounders past the corner infielders and be at second base in the blink of an eye. The Rays plan to deploy him as a multi-positional catalyst, a speedy, Chone Figgins-style player. Like Figgins, Edwards has elite speed and scouts prefer X at positions other than shortstop, but he can play there in a pinch. He'll be a super utility type who provides value commensurate with an everyday player because of the strength of his hit tool. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>","6mQrlNehRfo","sa3007018"

Recall that the last we saw Baz, he was parked at 95-99 and touching 101 in the 2019 Fall League, working out of the bullpen with his fastball, curveball, and cutter/slider. He did not throw during Feb/March spring training and instead joined the team at the summer tuneup camp and then at the alternate site in Port Charlotte, where his velocity (according to a source not with the Rays) was more in the 93-96 range, which is where he pitched as a starter during the 2019 regular season. This could be because he was working as a starter at the alt site (he was back to throwing four pitches there, as the changeup came back) or because he was told to dial it down and throw more strikes, or because adrenaline doesn't really flow when nothing is on the line, or some combination of these factors. I'm not inclined to move Baz in light of this (obviously) because he's still only 21 and probably had a weird year like the rest of us. I'm still betting on his frame, athleticism, and stuff. Maturity will likely come with age, though I'm not sure better tactile feel for release and location will, so I still have Baz projected in a high-leverage relief role. <em>(Alternate site)</em>","-j3khhUBqgI","sa3004765"

Both the dev staff and the analytics group in Tampa Bay love him at shortstop, and this comes after he only looked okay to the eye in college. From a minor league defensive data perspective, Clay Davenport had him as being worth six runs at shortstop in 2019. His first step, internal clock, and situational awareness, combined with suitable foot speed, actions, and arm strength, not only make him viable at short, but actually really good there. 
Offensively, Walls is a switch-hitter with great feel for the strike zone and for squaring balls all over it. He's kinda stiff and really doesn't have much power because his swing is so simplistic, instead punching a lot of liner singles over the heads of infielders. It's not a sexy skillset but it is a great general profile -- a switch-hitting shortstop with on base skills -- with enough physical tools to compete with big leaguers.

In the first start of his draft year, he hit 100 mph and flashed above average secondary stuff, which put him among the draft's top prospects right out of the gate. But things started to unravel from there. A finger injury, bad weather, fluctuating stuff, frustrating control, and questions about his maturity all contributed to a draft-day tumble to pick No. 31 and the hometown Rays. 
A year later, those concerns seemed trite. A more consistent, balanced delivery enabled McClanahan to throw more strikes and he absolutely carved A-ball. He got especially hot over a nine-game stretch at Hi-A, where he walked just eight over 49 innings. He ended up with 154 K in 120.2 innings, and reached Double-A. Then, after he had pitched at the alternate site all year, the Rays decided to foist McClanahan onto their playoff roster, and he made his big league debut in the playoffs. It did not go well, with McClanahan giving up a lot of really hard contact, but everyone got to see how hard he throws and how nasty his breaking stuff can be.

He is also a converted infielder who only began pitching recently, in Johnson's case during his sophomore season at Louisburg College (the Hurricanes), where he threw just six innings with a fastball that mostly sat in the upper-80s. He then transferred to Campbell, and it was during Fall practices there that his fastball touched the mid-90s and he flashed a plus breaking ball, instantly making him a high-priority look for the following spring (2019) when he was draft-eligible. His stock and performance peaked in late-March of his draft year, then dipped closer to the draft when he failed to get through five or more innings in five of his last eight starts. The Rays took him in the sandwich round and Johnson was only sitting 91-95 in 30-pitch outings after he signed, but remember that he had barely thrown the year before and was pitching more than ever before. 
The pre-draft dip left room for questions about his season-long durability, and those remain relevant after there was no opportunity for Johnson to answer them during a real 2020 minor league season. But he did show up at instructs sitting 92-98 (including entire outings toward the upper end of that range) and touching 99 with three secondaries that grade out well from a pitch data perspective. We don't yet know how Johnson will respond to a full season of innings as a starter, but he does have starter-quality repertoire depth. His slider (which sat 85-88 at instructs) and curveball both have plus raw spin (his slider's spin rate spiked once the Rays got hold of him), and Johnson has natural feel for killing spin and creating sink on his mid-80s changeup. There's some relief risk created by his delivery (his arm action is still long, and the Rays haven't tweaked his college mechanics at all) and lack of mechanical consistency, but he is a plus on-mound athlete who, again, has barely pitched. I'm comfortable projecting pretty heavily on Johnson's secondaries and command because of the context here. Certainly the relief risk causes Johnson to slide below where he'd rank based purely on his Fall stuff, but his relief outcome isn't all that different than Baz or McClanahan's. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3011342"

He was just 1.1 innings shy of graduating off prospect lists entirely in 2019, and would have graduated in 2020 had he stepped on a mound even once, but a bout with COVID delayed his activity at the alternate site, and then shoulder discomfort, which had plagued him the year before, resurfaced once he began to throw bullpens. The situation is similar to Cardinals righty Alex Reyes', who accrued 46 big league innings before he needed Tommy John, which derailed his ability to pitch out of the rotation early in his career due to the rehab timeline. This injury is especially scary for McKay since part of the reason he peaked as a 60 FV was because he projected to throw a ton of innings and generate 3-plus annual WAR on the strength of his durability. Now it sounds like he won't be ready for the start of camp. 
His fastball only sits 90-94 and touches 96, which is pretty average, but McKay keeps it away from the middle of the zone where it can really be hammered and often ties hitters up with it because he locates so well; his swinging strike rate on the heater was close to 17% in the minors, so I think it'll play. His cutter command is arguably even better, and he peppers the glove side of the plate with it at will. Changeup usage was scarce in his 49-inning big league sample but I think it will be one of the focal points of his repertoire, perhaps usurping the curveball, which has a stronger visual evaluation than it does if you look at the spin data. It's a repertoire/command profile similar to that of a lot of good lefties (Hyun Jin Ryu, Mike Minor, Cole Hamels), though most of them are more reliant on the cambio than McKay has been to this point. He now fits in with other major league-ready, strike-throwing 2 WAR starters toward the back of the top 100, though he needs to slide behind the ones who will be ready for the start of the season, and the ones who are coming off an elbow injury rather than a shoulder. <em>(Alternate site, Injured)</em>","aCKSVKfZpv0","20186"

Hunt got a $1.6 million bonus to keep him from going to Pepperdine, then put forth three solid, if unspectacular offensive seasons (.258/.341/.384) before having a huge breakout during 2020 Instructional League, during which he was suddenly hitting for much more in-game power. As a young pro, Hunt had a conservative in-game swing swing. He'd show you average raw power during BP but deploy a contact-oriented approach in games. His swing had virtually no stride, and he relied on strength to drive balls into the gaps for doubles, but that was it. Last Fall, Hunt's swing had more lower body movement and that, combined with another year of added body/strength maturation, makes him a much more dangerous hitter. I watched him park one halfway into the left-center field seats at Chase Field and he took Mason Thompson (who sat 96-99 that day) deep later that week, his second loud extra-base hit that day. He was one of a few buzzy Padres prospects (some of the others have also been traded) from the Fall, and he performed against a quality cross-section of pitching. 
Hunt's defense has backed up a little bit. He was catching on one knee, even with runners on base, and his footwork coming out of his crouch was inconsistent, which lead to inconsistent throwing accuracy. I've also seen him pop as low as 1.88 on throws to second and, despite his size, he’s agile enough and has sufficiently good hands to receive and frame big league stuff. I think the style with which Hunt catches will probably grow and change, especially as he shifts to an org that seems less inclined to put their catchers on one knee with runners on, and ultimately he'll be good back there. The thing to focus on here, though, is the potential power production from behind the plate, which now compels me to project him as an everyday player. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em> ","3EsET9nsQpE","sa3004153"

And that could be a very fast climb. Hernandez was perhaps the most dominant lower-level hitter in 2019, slashing .344/.433/.646 during the AZL regular season before going on an Arozarena-esque tear in the AZL and then Northwest League postseasons after he was promoted for the last week of Spokane's season. He slugged over .900 during his final few weeks in the org. The Rangers invited Hernandez to their alternate site in mid-September and he tuned up against advanced pitching there before getting most of his 2020 run at Fall Instructional League. Then the Rangers traded him as part of a deal centered around Nate Lowe early in the offseason. 
Heuristically, this is not the sort of prospect I like. Heriberto is a positionless righty hitter (and thus is often at a platoon disadvantage) far from the big leagues. But his on-paper stats, underlying TrackMan data, and my multi-year in-person visual evaluation give me a high degree of confidence that this might be a very special hitter whose hit and power combination will clear the high offensive bar in left field or first base. His little T-Rex arms enable Heriberto to be short to the baseball, but he's so strong and rotates with such ferocity that he still hits for power. I've seen him make mid-at-bat adjustments to quality offspeed stuff, swinging over a particularly good splitter only to recognize the next one, located in the same spot, and rope it into the left field corner for a double. He covers the whole plate (something that's gotten better since my first looks in 2018) but is tough to beat on the inner half because his levers are so short. Because he isn't an up-the-middle player, Hernandez is not the type of prospect with an elite-level WAR ceiling, but he has the talent to anchor the middle of an order as a hit/power combo bat. <em>(Rangers alternate site and Fall Instructional League)</em>","ADS4KB2jOhc","sa3005630"

After a strikeout-heavy freshman year in Wilmington, Jones cut his whiff total nearly in half as a draft-eligible sophomore. He also improved enough defensively to keep the shortstop projection alive, though some scouts think he may need to move to center field. It was enough for him to be in teams' mix in the comp round's zip code, and he was drafted 31st overall by the Rays. 
A year and a half later, Jones remained the same sort of player. He struggled during Extended Spring, but had a strong summer in the Penn League, which was a pretty conservative assignment.

He's also throwing his fastball a little bit harder and his changeup now has much more velocity and rests in the upper-80s. Boots-on-the-ground scouts who saw instructs echoed the sentiments of the amateur arm of the industry from before Goss was drafted: he can really pitch. He was a low-90s (touching mid-90s) changeup/command high schooler whose breaking balls relied on Goss' deceptive slot to play, but his stuff has improved without detracting from his pitchability.

For a month and a half of 2018, he showed mid-rotation stuff (92-97), then blew out his elbow and needed Tommy John. His rehab was slow and Strotman's fastball was down in the 90-93 range when he returned, then still a mediocre 91-95 with average secondary stuff late in the 2019 Fall League.

In the last year, I've better integrated an understanding of pitches' approach angle into my thinking, which helps explain how Ryan's stuff works. Pitchers with a release point lower than his (some notable names include Camillo Doval, Hector Yan, Victor Gonzalez) typically project as relievers, and it's rare for someone with a release point as low as Ryan's to also create something even approaching a backspinning axis (Ryan's fastball has about 1:00 tilt, whereas 12:00 would be perfect backspin) since most pitchers with lower release heights also have low arm slots. But Ryan's delivery is starter-y. His release height is low because, like a lot of the prospects in this system, his levers are really short. So Ryan's fastball approaches the plate at an upward angle and has some carry to it, which makes hitters swing underneath it a lot. There are some relief-only types (like James Karinchak) ahead of him, but among full-season minor league starters who threw upwards of 500 fastballs in 2019, Ryan's heater had the highest swinging strike rate. 
Part of the reason to wonder if Ryan ends up starting or relieving is because his secondary stuff is less strong. What I called a cutter last year now has more length to it and is clearly a slider. Aside from that, Ryan's mid-70s rainbow curveball and occasional changeup make up a command/control backend starter's four-pitch mix, it's just that he has a dominant fastball to pair with them. He used his fastball 73% of the time in 2019. There's no precedent for that level of usage among big league starters and there's no way of knowing how big league hitters will adjust to seeing that pitch so often until Ryan faces them. I'm going to bucket him in the multi-inning relief category where hitter adjustments are less likely to occur due to the nature of the job, and think Ryan could be a very good version of one. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3007584"

Offensively, he remains a contact-oriented lefty bat with an all-fields approach to contact and doubles pop. But while Proctor played shortstop at Rice and several infield positions in pro ball, he began converting to catcher in 2020 and made a remarkable amount of progress as a defender in a short period of time, going from ""bad"" to ""hey, this might actually work"" in a span of about four weeks during instructs according to the scouts who saw him there.

It's tough for long-legged infielders to be able to shorten their strides, increase the tempo of their steps, and bend like infielders need to, but Pie is pretty good at it for his size. He has an NBA wing player's frame, uncommon athleticism and body control for his size, uncapped power projection, and much more abstract intrigue than certainty about any aspect of the profile, but if you compare his frame, athleticism and showcase tools to those of same-aged domestic high school players, Pie looks like a first round talent. He runs well enough that center field is a possibility if he outgrows the infield.
Even if Pie tumbles down the defensive spectrum, it likely means he's grown into substantial raw power, enough to profile at any position. His current tool grade projections indicate what I think things will look like if his frame develops such that it allows him to stay at shortstop (the Goldilocks Zone), but I think it's going to take a long time before Pie's skillset truly comes into focus and we were robbed of a 2020 look because of COVID. <em>(DR Instructs)</em>","pROw9MwMoSw","sa3008754"

He ended up at Georgia, pitched out of the bullpen throughout much of his freshman year and routinely sat 97-99 in that role, often touching 100. As a starter in 2020, Wilcox sat 93-96 with more consistent command (he walked no hitters in his final three starts and walked just two in 23 total innings) than he had as a freshman, and more effective slider shape. The Padres drafted Wilcox in the third round and gave him $3.3 million, which broke the record for a third rounder's bonus, one they set the previous year with Hudson Head. Wilcox went to instructs -- I have one report from the Fall and Wilcox was 93-94, which is fine considering the context -- and was then traded to the Rays as part of the Blake Snell deal. 
When it's right, Wilcox has a biting, two-plane out pitch in the slide piece, which sits in the 85-89 range and often has more length than any pitch that hard has a right to be. Those two pitches and his current command would be enough to project Wilcox in a late-inning bullpen role, but a better change or split (the development of which was slowed by his freshman role) would enable him to be a mid-rotation piece so long as he retains his velo in pro ball, since the shape of the heater makes it velocity-dependent. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em>","mUKE04zP5UU","sa3014443"

That window closed quickly due to the pandemic, so teams' opinions of Bitsko were driven by what he did in the Fall of 2019 (he was 92-96 in front of heavy-hitting eyeballs at East Coast Pro) and, in the case of some teams, what they saw in the bullpen just before the shutdown and any pitch data Bitsko generated thereafter. In all instances, Bitsko's arm strength, curveball, and touch-and-feel command were on par with first round high school arms, though that demographic's track record is scary and has been devalued by teams. That, combined with the possibility that some teams weren't be comfortable taking a player they've barely seen, made Bitsko's stock pretty volatile.

He spent 2020 at the Rays' alt site and then had yet another amazing winter ball performance in Mexico. Quiroz was Team Mexico’s leadoff hitter during the 2017 WBC (he hit two homers and a double in six at-bats) and spent 2015-17 crushing the Mexican League. He signed with Boston in November 2017, and was hot the following April at Double-A, but then missed three and a half months with an abdominal strain. He only played in 24 games at Double-A, then had 62 extra plate appearances in the Arizona Fall League, where he played well and was seen by the entire pro scouting community. San Diego traded a 40-man crunch relief arm to Boston for Quiroz, then later flipped him to Tampa Bay as part of the Tommy Pham deal. 
This is a very Rays sort of prospect. He has deft, all-fields contact ability and can (kind of) play an up-the-middle position. Quiroz presents rare 40-man flexibility because he's arguably ready to contribute to a big league lineup (albeit near the bottom) right now, but because of how recently he signed, doesn't have to occupy a 40-man spot until this December, meaning he can act as viable, above-replacement upper-level depth without occupying a 40-man spot. He lacks the defensive versatility to play a long-term bench role but it wouldn't surprise me if he ended up being a low-end second base regular for someone for a couple of seasons. <em>(Alternate site, Mexican Pacific League)</em>",,"sa596560"

That nearly unprecedented velocity for his age obviously garnered a lot of attention in the scouting community, though Gaston often had 20 control when he scraped triple digits. He also isn't classically projectable -- his velocity is already at the top of the scale and he has a maturely-built frame at 6-foot, but he's done some arm slot and arm action tinkering over the last few years that has affected his control and command. So while Gaston may get stronger as he physically matures, what's more important is the projection of his feel for pitching, which appears to be more natural at a three-quarters arm slot with velocity more in the mid-90s, where his arm action is also more naturally online, than the higher slot where he was throwing harder and wilder. 
Gaston's best pitching performance was as the main event on the mound at the Víctor Víctor Mesa workout at Marlins Park, where the better version of his arm slot, arm action, and control was first seen by a large scouting audience. It didn't hold. Gaston walked a batter per inning in his first pro season while sitting in the 93-97 range with the fastball.
