He remains a very intriguing prospect not just because the quality of the contact is good but because he's a plus-plus third base defender with rare speed for the position. It's possible to attribute what appear to be some plateauing traits to the previous Pirates regime's issues with player development and perhaps what is in essence a fresh start will unlock something that's currently lying dormant. At age 23, it's looking a little less likely now than at this time last year when we 60'd Hayes, with the currently sky-high offensive bar at third base contributing to that sentiment.","o76lKnW1nX0","sa874730"
"Oneil Cruz","PIT","SS",,32,2,,"55",2021,,"21.7777777","6' 7""","175","L","R",2015,"J2","LAD",950000,"Dominican Republic","Somehow, over the past year, the ratio of scouts who believe the 6-foot-7 Cruz might actually stay at shortstop has grown. It's more within the realm of possibility for those who think a lot of issues with lateral agility can be masked through some combination of arm strength (Cruz has a freaking hose) and good defensive positioning. What if this guy, who I'll once again body-comp to Harold Carmichael and Brandon Ingram before I search for a less instructive baseball avatar, actually stays there and grows into 80-grade raw power? How bad would the contact issues need to be for him not to be a great player if that's the case? 
Indeed there are folks in baseball who are skeptical of Cruz's hit tool because of his lever length, and those concerns are exacerbated by how often he likes to swing. There are several vastly different ideas as to how his body and game will develop as he fills out, and scouts who think Cruz is destined to slow down and move to right field or first base, and who also have concerns about the contact, don't even think he belongs on this list. But consider this: At this age Aaron Judge, who is as close as we're going to get to a physical peer for Cruz, was striking out 21% of the time at Fresno State. Split between Hi- and Double-A, against competition way better than Mountain West Conference pitching, Cruz whiffed 25% of the time. That's not bad for someone this age and this size. I will concede that the approach is bad and that the swing needs polish if Cruz is going to get to his power in games. I'll also concede that the Fall League look was bad (he missed several weeks with a foot fracture), and his LIDOM performance was, too. This is one of the -- if not <em>the</em> -- highest-variance players in the minors, but there aren't many who have a chance to be what this guy might. Even the outcomes more toward the middle of what is likely -- a center fielder with a hit tool in the 35-40 range with huge power, a right fielder or third baseman with the same, a gigantic target at first -- are still fine. I'm way, way in on Cruz even though he has clear issues that make him one of baseball's riskier players.","GzwLKufiG4A","sa917318"

(His fastball still has a little less life than would best pair with his curveball, but I don't have him on the high speed camera yet to see if he's pronating behind the baseball.) Keller quickly got comfortable locating that slider, which has an awful lot of sweep for a pitch in the upper-80s, to his glove side. He can throw competitively-located changeups against left-handed hitters, but in big spots a well-placed slider is just a nastier option. Aside from the little bit of carry that might be added to his heater, Keller is now a four-pitch strike-thrower with a state-of-the-art repertoire.","BbF8a3acDUU","17594"

There aren't many young, high-variance arms on this list, but Thomas' frame, his fresh arm, his elite velo, and how enthused I am about the breaking ball, changeup, and command projection because of how athletic he is gives him a chance to attain some nutty right tail outcomes.","KvPrGPYdZ9g","sa3003066"

Instead, it's his 2019 Cape Cod line -- .351/.451/.630 -- and algorithms that can better estimate Gonzales' realistic output by utilizing hit data that will carry his statistical case in draft rooms. Visual evaluations of Gonzales suggest he has a chance to both play a premium defensive position and hit for a lot of power, though Gonzales lacks fundamental consistency on defense. He will botch some routine plays and make some spectacular ones, at times looking like a passable middle infielder and others like he belongs in the outfield. If he can stay on the MIF Gonzales might be a star. He has the most explosive hitting hands in the draft among college hitters not named Spencer Torkelson, hands that work a lot like Nationals prospect Carter Kieboom's do. There's certainly more statistical volatility here than is typical for a college hitter, and where Gonzales fits on teams' boards in the top then might depend on how well he played defense when their decision-makers saw him.","ERjO24Hja8Q",

We have one here in Liover Peguero, who is a Jean Segura starter kit. His sloped shoulders, short torso, and the high, thick butt and thighs map to a slightly taller version of Segura. More significantly, like Segura, Peguero is remarkably short back to the baseball; his barrel enters the hitting zone in the blink of an eye, giving him an extra beat to decide whether or not to swing. It also makes it hard for pitchers to beat him with velocity, since he's rarely late on anything and has quick enough hands to get on top of pitches near the top of the strike zone. He's also remarkably strong in the hands and wrists for a teenager and is already producing average exit velos above the big league average, though Peguero cuts down at the ball and is currently groundball prone. His swing may get longer as his attack angle changes. 
Perhaps the place where the Segura and Peguero Venn Diagram does not overlap is on the defensive end of things. Peguero is a plus athlete with above-average hands and arm strength, which could make him an above-average defender at short in time. If his lower half thickens and Peguero slows down, he'll look more like Segura does now on defense.","kBYfk4hzOdY","sa3005582"

Malone's repertoire is a bit more fully realized but Priester has more room on his frame, better natural ability to spin the ball, and comes from a cold-weather background that often leaves a greater developmental gap between present and future pitchability traits. Pretty early in high school, Priester was firmly on the radar as a big-framed righty with a good breaking ball. His stuff ticked up closer to the draft, when he was consistently in the mid-90s, and he was 91-95, touching 96 after he signed, and his changeup showed late growth, too.

For his draft year, he transferred to IMG Academy in Florida and took another step forward, reminiscent of how Touki Toussaint added feel elements to his profile in his draft year. Malone switched to a more controllable version of his breaker, a 55-grade slider that flashes 60 for some scouts and that he can dot anywhere. Malone hit 99 mph in his last outing of the spring in front of a lot of heat and sits in the mid-90s for full outings. His curveball and changeup are both about average, giving him a mid-rotation starter look, with the usual injury caveats for a power prep righty.","q2V5lLIeZys","sa3011741"

He went undrafted as an eligible sophomore at Arizona because he was too raw and inexperienced due to a total lack of reps while in high school. He emerged as a speed/raw power flier as a junior, but slid to the Pirates in the seventh round and signed for slot. His performance in 2018, his first full pro season, exceeded all expectations: in his 172-game college career, Oliva produced nine homers and a .773 OPS, while in 108 games at Hi-A, he hit nine homers with a .778 OPS despite skipping Low-A. He has a flatter swing that doesn't enable his raw power to play but the on-base ability and speed might enable him to be a center field regular anyway.","C8mb_GuvJGA","sa915844"

Healthy Bolton touches 97 and will show you a plus slider and average changeup. He sat 86-90 as a rising high school senior but has since altered the timing of his arm swing for the better, and the resulting velo is fairly new, which makes Bolton's cogent strike-throwing more impressive.

He was wrapped up in the Braves' international indiscretions and had his deal with the club voided by MLB. (The <em>New York Times</em> reported that although Bae had agreed to sign for $300,000, the Braves planned to pay him an additional $600,000 by reallocating money promised to other signees to him.) Because he had skipped the KBO's draft to sign with an MLB team, the KBO barred him from signing with any South Korean pro team for two years. When he hit the market again, Bae signed with Pittsburgh for $1.25 million. He was found guilty of and later suspended for assaulting his former girlfriend in an incident that occurred on New Year's Eve 2017. After the suspension and a treatment/education program, Bae returned to the field and was skipped over two levels and sent to full-season ball at age 19, where he hit .323/.403/.430. 
His domestic assault conviction impacts how teams (and people, in general) view, value, and interact with him, but purely on talent, some clubs think he belonged on my top 100 list. Bae's arm may prevent him from playing shortstop, but if that's the case he'll still fit at second base and he has the speed to play center field. It's possible his lack of power hurts his on-base skills as he climbs the minors and pitchers attack him without fear of him doing extra-base damage (he has no minor league home runs yet), but Bae's gotten stronger, his exit velos took a leap last year, and he has premium rotational ability.

Castro has a good chance to add strength as he ages without compromising his ability to play second base. His hitting hands are explosive but still pretty uncoordinated, especially from the left side of the plate, though that's pretty common for switch-hitters this age. Even though it doesn't always look pretty, Castro's batted ball results indicate he actually has good feel for consistently hitting the ball hard (43% of his balls in play were hit at 95 mph or above, a 60 on the scale) and in the air. He'll probably be a low-OBP hitter so he needs to out-slug that deficiency, but he has a chance to do that.",,"sa917362"

He throws really, really hard, has a vertical slot that creates carry at the top of the zone, and though his curveball lacks huge depth, it does play well with the heater due to its vertical shape. 
Because of when he signed, Mears doesn't need to be added to the 40-man for a couple of years, and the rebuilding Pirates have incentive to slow-play this one. But Mears' stuff is probably ready right now, and I think he has a shot to be a high-leverage option. ",,"sa3008594"

The lift in Mitchell's cut enabled him to golf out 15 homers in the pitcher-friendly Florida State League even though Mitchell doesn't have much raw power right now. His frame isn't very big and it's unlikely he'll ever grow into impact pop, but whatever power Mitchell ends up with, it's a fair bet he'll get to it in games because of his feel for lift. His swing-happy approach is a bit of a problem. Above-average feel for contact has enabled it to this point, but the way his peripherals moved last year is somewhat concerning.

Most of their tools live at or near average and they don't have obviously projectable builds -- they're simply well-rounded players and good athletes who tend to perform in high school games. 
There could be give (power) and take (speed) that pushes Siani to left field, or he may end up with a lighter hitting center field profile.

Martin hits the ball very hard and hits it in the air regularly.

Typically, first base-only profiles, even ones I like, with any sort of blemish get relegated to the 40 FV tier, but Martin's premium raw power, the lift in his swing, and his approach make me more bullish about him profiling as a three true outcomes first baseman than most players with similarly-shaped skillsets.",,"sa3004885"

He has some nascent feel for creating sinking movement on a changeup, but he doesn't often locate it competitively right now. That's true for most of his offerings at the moment and there's an awful lot of relief risk here, but the notion that Florez might throw even harder in short bursts combined with a shot to have three major league-quality offerings means that even if he ends up in relief, he could be dominant.

His stroke is comically simple and it's amazing how he's able to rotate and generate lift and power with such minimal activity before his hands fire. It's going to be a tough right field profile and some hit tool questions will eventually need to be answered, but the raw and game power look like they're going to clear the right field bar if Mr. Herman hits.",,"sa3007877"

His swing has changed several times, his 2019 Low-A numbers (he slugged .450) are wholly unsupported by his TrackMan data (82 mph exit velos, a 30 on the scale), and we didn't see him play much center field after he was promoted to Bradenton because of Travis Swaggerty's presence. Some of his poor performance there, and historically, needs to be considered with his age (20, young for every level he's played at) in mind. The pull-heavy approach here doesn't make sense given the speed and contact rates but I still like that Sanchez is as fast as he is and has displayed precocious feel for the barrel. I think the outcome here is probably that of a bench outfielder but my degree of confidence is lower because Lolo's development to this point has been so strange.",,"sa917767"

In 2019 he was back, throwing hard, and has a typical middle relief fastball/slider combination. He probably could have used a promotion last year, but keeping De Los Santos at Low-A at his age perhaps successfully hid him from model-driven teams with a Rule 5 spot.
