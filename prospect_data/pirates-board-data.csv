The data does some pushing and pulling. In about a month, Hayes hit a whopping .376/.442/.682, ranked fourth among all hitters with a 195 wRC+, and led all NL rookies with 1.7 WAR even though he only played in 24 games. And Hayes was hitting the ball hard. His big league average exit velocity (just shy of 93 mph) and HardHit% (55%) were both above what he posted in the 2019 minors (91 mph, 48%) when he only hit 10 homers over a 100 games. But his .450 BABIP is unsustainable and, per Statcast, his xwOBA (.356) came in well below his actual wOBA (.464), indicating that he was also the beneficiary of some luck. There's no accounting for how big league pitching might expose a weakness and begin to adjust to Hayes, even if it's just to limit his power output rather than get him out. But his approach is responsive enough that I think he'll target pitches he can drive and do enough damage to, when coupled with his world-class defense at third base, make him a multi-time All-Star. <em>(Alternate Site, MLB)</em>","o76lKnW1nX0","18577"

He showed up in Bradenton sitting 94-97, continuing the climbing velocity trend he began to exhibit throughout his senior spring in 2019. He went from showing a lot of 91-94 during his pre-draft summer to sitting comfortably in the mid-90s, then settled back into the 91-95 range the summer after Pittsburgh made him the first high school arm selected in 2019. 
He added a considerable amount of strength over the last year and a half, and has also made some subtle mechanical changes. His glove has migrated north during his gather, his arm swing isn't as long, he's clearing his front side better, and he lands with more control and balance in his blocking leg. I'd understand some hesitancy to alter one's evaluation of someone like this based on the context of the look, since Priester had most of the year off and came out throwing just a few innings at a time in a very controlled environment, but because the uptick in velocity has been coupled with physical and mechanical changes, I'm more inclined to believe it's real. And perhaps I've buried the lede here: Priester has one of the nastier curveballs in the minors, and maybe in all of baseball. He had feel for creating shape on his breaking ball in high school but it wasn't nearly as hard as it is now, nor was its movement as sharp, vertical, and vicious. It comes out of his hand high and then crests and drops with the curvature and angle of a waterfall of seams and leather. It has Adam Wainwright's curveball's shape but is harder, and Priester is going to use it to embarrass a lot of big league hitters. He had some changeup feel in high school and now that he's wielding huge arm strength, that has backed up a little bit. I'm betting that will improve as he gets starter's innings in 2021. His delivery is still somewhat violent and arm-y but it's better now than in high school, and he has less command-based reliever risk than other pitchers toward the back of the Top 100. Those who read these lists consistently know that what I'm about to say is not often seen on these electronic pages: Priester has top-of-the-rotation ceiling. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3011297"

They have similar builds, their hitting hands work in a similar, aesthetically-pleasing loop, and like Hiura, Gonzales also faced questions about his ultimate defensive fit, albeit for different reasons. The altitude at New Mexico State (Las Cruces is 3,900 feet above sea level) aided his offensive output there (he had a .399/.502/.747 career line), but his 2019 Cape Cod line (.351/.451/.630 with wood bats against great pitching) carried a ton of weight in draft rooms, and it certainly didn't hurt that in the weeks leading up to the COVID shutdown, Gonzales went on an epic heater and homered 12 times in 16 games. 
Despite the huge power output, Gonzales' offensive skill set is more well-rounded, and he's also been described to me as ""a good hitter with some power"" rather than a middle-of-the order force of some kind. I don't think he has the barrel accuracy or striking power of Hiura, but Gonzales is really difficult to beat with velocity in the strike zone and has the strength and plate coverage to drive fastballs the opposite way. He'll also scoop and yank hanging breaking balls toward the left field seats, but the home run pop here is more mistake-dependent than it is a constant worry for opposing pitchers. He'll need to become more fundamentally sound around the bag at second to stay there (I think he'll initially play shortstop in pro ball but move to the keystone relatively soon), but if he can then Gonzales pretty comfortably profiles as a solid everyday player. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>","ERjO24Hja8Q","sa3014510"

His arm action is very similar to Shane Bieber's, and it's very short for a pitcher with Thomas' shooting guard build. While his frame, athleticism and arm strength all remain elite, Thomas' breaking stuff remains inconsistent and unremarkable, and he still lacks any modicum of changeup feel. I'm still confident Thomas will end up with a good breaking ball, even if it only gets there because of either his ability to command it so consistently or through sheer velocity if he ends up in the bullpen, which will happen if he can't find a third pitch. He may need to experiment with a split if there's going to be one since the action changeup grip and release didn't seem to suit him in the Fall. A bullpen projection means Thomas would need to slide south on this list closer to Brailyn Marquez, who's closer to the big leagues. There remains huge upside here, in part because Thomas still hasn't pitched all that much, and the pandemic prevented him from doing so. At one point Jacob deGrom was also nothing but arm strength and an elite pitcher's frame, but Tahnaj has been hovering in that area for a little over a year now. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em>","KvPrGPYdZ9g","sa3003066"

It's a tragic and murky situation hanging over one of the more interesting prospects in the sport. Cruz slides from last year's ranking because his approach remains a real problem.

He is remarkably short back to the baseball; his barrel enters the hitting zone in the blink of an eye, giving him an extra beat to decide whether or not to swing. It also makes it hard for pitchers to beat him with velocity, since he's rarely late on anything and has quick enough hands to get on top of pitches near the top of the strike zone. He's also remarkably strong in the hands and wrists for someone his age, and in 2019 produced exit velos above the big league average. Peguero cuts down at the ball and is currently groundball prone. His swing may get longer as his attack angle changes. I think he'll end up a 55 bat with mostly doubles power. The physicality for more than that is here, I just can't see teasing it out of the swing. At shortstop, that should be fine.

Yajureâ€™s fastball rests in the 90-95 range with cut and carry, a velocity band he only began working in as he built strength during rehab from a 2017 Tommy John surgery. His best secondary pitch is his changeup, which Yajure did not have great feel for out of the bullpen during his brief 2020 big league debut, but which was his best bat-missing weapon during his 2019 breakout. He also has a nasty-looking 12-to-6 curveball that has serious bite and depth, but I'm not sure if big league hitters will be flummoxed by it since it comes out of his hand with such a big arc and might be easy to identify. The slider and cutter are fine, but rely on Yajureâ€™s ability to execute them to his glove side consistently, and while heâ€™s been able to do that in the minors, he just could not find release consistency during his big league outings.

For his draft year, he transferred to IMG Academy in Florida and took another step forward, reminiscent of how Touki Toussaint added feel elements to his profile in his draft year. Malone switched to a more controllable version of his breaker, a 55-grade slider that flashes 60 for some scouts and that he can dot anywhere, and he hit 99 mph in his last outing of the spring in front of a lot of heat. His curveball and changeup are both about average, and his fastball sits in the mid-90s for full outings, giving him a mid-rotation starter look, with the usual injury caveats for a power prep righty. After the Diamondbacks drafted him, he was a little less consistent during his first pro summer, and he was later part of a trade for Starling Marte. His frame is a little less projectable than most other pitchers his age, so rather than watching to see if Malone's velocity climbs, I'm watching to see if it can hold it throughout a whole season. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em>","q2V5lLIeZys","sa3011741"

He was wrapped up in the Braves' international indiscretions and had his deal with the club voided by MLB. (The <em>New York Times</em> reported that although Bae had agreed to sign for $300,000, the Braves planned to pay him an additional $600,000 by reallocating money promised to other signees to him.) Because he had skipped the KBO's draft to sign with an MLB team, the KBO barred him from signing with any South Korean pro team for two years. When he hit the market again, Bae signed with Pittsburgh for $1.25 million. He was found guilty of and later suspended for assaulting his former girlfriend in an incident that occurred on New Year's Eve 2017. After the suspension and a treatment/education program, Bae returned to the field, and was skipped over two levels and sent to full-season ball at age 19, where he hit .323/.403/.430. 
His domestic assault conviction impacts how teams (and people, in general) view, value, and interact with him, but purely on talent, some clubs think he belonged on my top 100 list. Bae's arm may prevent him from playing shortstop, but if that's the case he'll still fit at second base and he has the speed to play center field. It's possible his lack of power hurts his on-base skills as he climbs the minors and pitchers attack him without fear of him doing extra-base damage (he has no minor league home runs yet), but Bae's gotten stronger, his exit velos took a leap in 2019, and he has premium rotational ability.

If you've been following both the prospect lists and the siteâ€™s analysis of the recent Padres deals, you'll know the Friars have a penchant for taking expensive gambles on pop-up high school prospects. Head, who signed for a record-setting bonus ($3 million, basically slot at 22nd overall) in the third round, was one of their 2019 selections of this ilk. A two-sport athlete whose football exploits (he was in a QB timeshare at a 6A school) cut into his time on the showcase circuit (though he was known in Texas), Head eschewed his commitment to Oklahoma to turn pro. 
Sometimes prospects whoâ€™ve never faced the upper echelon of high school pitching require a prolonged adjustment period upon first entering affiliated ball due to the leap in stuff quality from varsity high school ball, even if that prospect comes from a talent-rich area like Texas or Southern California. But that was not an issue for Head against pro pitching in the 2019 AZL. Despite some clear mechanical flaws, he sprayed hard contact all over the field and hit .283/.383/.417 against the best pitching heâ€™d ever seen in his life. Then we had the long 2020 layoff, and my look at Head in fall instructs after he hadnâ€™t faced live pitching for nearly a year was not as good. He wasn't tracking pitches as well, he was late on some pretty average fastballs, he lacked balance at the plate, and his pitch recognition backed up. His swing does have an arm bar, but that was also true in 2019 when he was letting the ball travel deep and hitting it hard the other way. He added a footwork component that wasn't there in 2019, an extra toe-tap before his stride. I can't outright declare this to have been detrimental, it just wasn't there when he was successful. During the Padres' final day of intrasquads, he (ironically) half-swung at an Omar Cruz fastball that was way inside, which hit Head on the hands (sorry if thatâ€™s confusing), causing him to leave the game. 
None of this is enough for me to move off of where I had Head evaluated last year, though. Because of the lack of minor league season, the 2020 Instructional League was full of pitching that was typically more advanced than what Head would have seen during a normal instructs, and he was dropped into that environment after not playing all year. And letâ€™s not forget that Head has some unique athletic traits. Heâ€™s ambidextrous, and swings and throws a baseball with his left hand though he quarterbacked primarily with his right, occasionally using his left when he rolled out that way. I still think heâ€™s a potential traditional big league leadoff hitter, but while some others young kids really blew up on the backfields last Fall, Head struggled. The context for those struggles is important, though. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3010889"

Evaluating Escotto last year was pretty simple. Just as the domestic amateur side of the industry does during the high school showcase circuit, Escotto was identified as likely to remain at shortstop based on the feet, hands and actions he shows during infield drills. Fold in his BP and you can easily make apples-to-apples comparisons between him and domestic amateur infielders eligible for the draft, giving you a pretty good idea of where Escotto fits in among them. Add the stats generated by Escotto in the DSL to the data I source and make available on The Board, and you get a clear idea that he has a chance to make a well-rounded offensive impact and that perhaps the visual eval should be rounded up based on the strength of the data. Escotto was on last yearâ€™s Picks to Click list but I couldn't justify moving him onto the Top 100 with literally no new information (the Yankees had no Instructional League) beyond the fact that Pittsburgh clearly also likes him, so he'll stay in the 40+ FV tier, which means the Pirates have added the equivalent of a second round high school shortstop to their system. <em>(At-home dev)</em>",,"sa3008878"
