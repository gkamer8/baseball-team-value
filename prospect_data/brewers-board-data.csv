"Aaron Ashby","MIL","MIRP","AAA",124,0,,"50",2022,"Med","23.0305555","6' 1""","181","L","L",2018,"Draft","MIL",520000,"Crowder JC (MO)","Ashby showed up at instructs sitting 94-97 (I saw him twice), with two routinely plus breaking balls, and flashed a firm, diving changeup on occasion. It's fair to wonder whether the context of the look impacted how hard Ashby was throwing (it's not as if he'd been throwing every fifth day for several months, though it was toward the end of instructs) and he isn't exactly a precise strike-thrower, but his fastball velocity has been trending up for a few consecutive years now, and all three of his secondary pitches have bat-missing action. I think he'll either end up in a strikeout-heavy, five-and-dive role or become a vicious multi-inning reliever.","v72e75qt5lg","sa3007225"
