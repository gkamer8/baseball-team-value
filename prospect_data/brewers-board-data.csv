He has a chance to be a plus defender who reaches base a lot, which is basically what J.P. Crawford's skill base was, even when he was struggling. It's possible that upper-level pitching challenges Turang with impunity and his walk rates tank, at which point I'll move off him. If his frame, which is broad-shouldered and quite projectable, fills out and suddenly there's relevant pop, he's an everday player.","ndJStZbwH1c","sa3008294"

He is one of the more talented offensive catching prospects in the minors thanks to a potent combination of power and barrel feel. When Feliciano puts balls in play, they're very often scorched -- just under 50% of the balls he hit last year entered play at 95 mph or above, which is a 65 on the 20-80 scale if you curve out big leaguers' hard hit rates. All of that seems likely to be hampered by Feliciano's hedonistic approach. The dude likes to swing, and has only walked at a 6% clip as a pro. 
Scouts also have tepid opinions about his defense, but let's remember that he's essentially a JUCO-aged player who missed a year of development due to injury. I anticipate some defensive improvement, and think we'll have a electronic strike zone a year or two after Feliciano hits the 40-man, which will help him stay back there. His approach is kind of scary and there's a chance his contact profile bottoms out against big league pitchers who prey on his swing-happy nature, but I have Feliciano evaluated as an everyday catcher based on how much power I think he'll hit for, even if he's running OBPs close to .310.","D6SDMu7h_Q","sa917954"

Curt, punchy, and geared for gap contact, Mitchell's current cut is more fluid and dynamic than it was in high school, when teams had million-dollar evals on him despite largely taking issue with his swing efficacy, but he still has limited power utility on pitches away from him. The swing changes Mitchell made at UCLA are perhaps evidence he can make more as a pro, but I think this gap approach works fine and is best depoyed by sprinters like Mitchell, who has retained his plus-plus speed despite bulking up quite a bit since high school. Without impact game power Mitchell is unlikely to be a star, but the offensive improvements he made in college combined with his defensive fit in center give him a good shot to be an everyday center fielder.",,

His skillset remains the same: big power, some stiffness and limited bat control, and an ability to crush lefties. Lutz's overall performance in two full pro seasons has been just shy of what I'm comfortable with 50 FV'ing but he's been very young for his level and only took three at-bats off of pitchers who were younger than him last year.

His two breaking balls need better demarcation, but they each flash plus and Ashby will even show you an average changeup on occasion. Since he has viable starter's stuff, it's logical for the Brewers to continue developing him in that role just in case he develops starter's control later than is typical, and also to refine that secondary stuff with more reps than he'd get in the bullpen. Coming off his age-21 season, Ashby was on pace to reach Double-A during the back half of this year before the world turned upside down.

In both my look and those of several scouts, he featured something like 80% fastballs. Teams have disparate opinions of Kelly. Some are intrigued by the canvas he presents, while others think painting it will be a chore. He need only develop one pitch to be a power reliever, which I think is pretty realistic.",,"sa3011135"

If there's an Oliver Drake delivery comp in the minors, it's Lazar (though he gets much lower to the ground), and like Drake, he can somehow turn over a changeup from this arm slot. We've seen fastballs thrive despite mediocre velocity before. Often it's from someone who has an extremely vertical arm slot, like Drake or Josh Collmenter, or huge extension and a flat approach angle, like Yusmeiro Petit, guys who can successfully remove the table cloth without disturbing the place settings. Lazar has both of these, and has a bat-missing changeup, too. I'm not as confident in the breaking stuff, which often finishes high in the zone -- it's that aspect of the skillset I'm scared will be exposed by upper-level hitting. Even if they don't develop further, Lazar has two legit weapons that would work fine in relief, and he throws strikes at such a high rate that he could be a multi-inning piece. Based on how Milwaukee deployed him last year -- 10 starts, nine relief outings, highly variable pitch counts -- it appears he's being groomed for a non-traditional role of some kind.",,"sa3005163"

Garcia had an eye-opening 2018 instructional league. His range, hands, actions and arm are all easy fits at shortstop, and he could be a plus glove there at peak. His entire offensive profile depends on his frame filling out. Garcia's lack of strength is evident with the bat in his hands, but you can go kind of nuts projecting on much of his skillset, including the speed and arm strength, because he so clearly has lots of physical growth on the horizon and is an above-average athlete. He's so young that he wasn't even eligible to sign immediately on July 2nd because he was still 15. Were he a domestic high schooler, he wouldn't have been draft eligible until 2020, and he's still just shy of 18.

He's a 40+ FV relief prospect on talent, the second or third best guy in a good bullpen (a set-up type for the traditionalists), but I've got to account for his injury history, perhaps more so than for all but a handful of pitchers in the minors, and so he's shaded down a little bit.",,"sa829799"

Drops in spin rate seem to occur as part of injury-related stuff regression, but that's often paired with a downtick in velo, and there wasn't one here, nor was there an IL stint. Instead, it's possible a change was made to intentionally reduce Brown's fastball spin, since his arm slot and fastball spin axis are more conducive of sinker movement. The point is, there was a change amid Brown's struggles, something that may be undone or further adjusted. It's why I'm staying on him despite the age and the offseason indication (via the Rule 5) that a big chunk of the industry is not. I have Brown projected in middle relief.",,"sa738901"

He's a great athlete and has surprisingly good instincts in the outfield, though he's not likely to play a real role as a position player.

After a rocky start and demotion to A-ball, he was shelved for two months and returned as a reliever, rehabbing in rookie ball late in the year. Milwaukee has stubbornly continued to develop him as a starter but I think he fits as an up/down reliever.",,"sa876362"

He's not that projectable, but he's athletically built and has a good arm action. He needs to refine his strike-throwing pretty badly and it would be nice if he ended up throwing harder, but the repertoire works well together, and I think he has a good shot to be a big league bullpen piece.",,"sa3005216"
