His at-bats have a big league veteran quality, and this, combined with his constant energy and verve, make him a very dangerous leadoff hitter prospect. Though not likely to hit for significant over-the-fence power, mostly due to his approach rather than a lack of strength, Carroll whistles balls into the gaps and down both baselines, then kicks it into top gear very quickly and punishes outfielders slow to corral the ball by turning their lackadaisical fielding into extra bases. So exceptional are Carroll's hand-eye coordination and barrel accuracy, especially for his age, that he now has among the best hit tool projections in the minors. It's a skillset very similar to Brett Gardner's, except Carroll can play center field. There are players this age with a higher ceiling because of their potential power production, but Carroll is a very high-floor prospect who I expect will produce at an All-Star level for much of his career. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>","sUghxoNDJ4g","sa3010593"

Kristian Robinson is among the most talented and prominent of those affected. After parts of three years in the warmth and security of the complex, it was time for Robinson to go to full-season ball and perform, and start to reinforce the tools- and frame-based excitement he had generated as a teenager. Instead Robinson spent another year sequestered in Scottsdale, too green to be part of the D-backs official alternate site group until he was added later in the summer. By the time Fall Instructional League rolled around and scouts were able to see him, Robinson looked rusty. He took poor at-bats and struck out a lot while missing hittable pitches in the zone.  But if any player, at any level were to struggle for a couple weeks, it'd easily be dismissed as a brief slump or tough-luck dry spell rather than a true regression, and that's even before considering the individual player's context. Robinson's 2020 was supposed to be about making adjustments to full-season pitching and getting his swing to a place that would allow for more in-game power. Instead it meant an entire year away from competitive baseball, a whole year away from home, an unspoken indication from the org that he had been passed by Corbin Carroll (who was invited to the alt site group immediately), and more monotonous developmental ball during instructs. 
Let's not lose sight of the foundation here: Robinson is built like a young Larry Fitzgerald, and he entered pro ball without the same kind of performance track record as most of his Dominican peers but still received the fourth-largest bonus in his signing class because his tools are so huge. In 2019, he hit 50% of his balls in play with an exit velo of 95 mph or more, which is up in Joey Gallo/Nelson Cruz territory. It is not normal to see a person like this on a baseball field, and Robinson has uncommon potential because of it. The questions that need answering here are the same as last year: Can Kristian turn a suitable swing foundation into one with impact, and can he perform against more advanced pitching? He'll hit 35-plus bombs every year if he can. For now, he fits in the Top 100 continuum near the 55/50 FV line, along with several other prospects of extreme variance and ceiling. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>","U24cWc3kkog","sa3006884"

Alek Thomas' frame reads as Lilliputian on paper, but in reality, he's quite strong and has one of the more athletic swings in all of the minors. Since he was drafted, Thomas' swing has evolved to mirror the intensity of prospect-era Cody Bellinger's, and sometimes Thomas swings so hard that he looks like he's going to corkscrew himself into the ground. His leg kick is a little bigger and slower now than it was when he was an amateur and first-year pro, and his stride is longer, which might help him avoid cutting down at the ball so much. The change to his swing and his approach -- Thomas was once an all-fields spray sort of hitter but was trying to pull the ball constantly during my instructs look, though maybe he was just bored -- could allow for more in-game power. 
The foundation of Thomas' prospectdom was his advanced baseball acumen and feel for contact, both of which were surprising for a cold weather prospect. But he was good enough to play in several upper-class events as an underclassman during his amateur career, and he performed in those consistently. He tracks pitches well and moves the bat head around the zone, and those underlying skills as well as Thomas' athleticism and (unlike Bellinger) shorter levers help enable him to take these new, huge hacks without striking out a ton. Some underlying 2019 metrics indicate Thomas indeed needed a swing tweak to unlock some in-game pop. He averaged just shy of 90 mph off the bat in 2019 and about 48% of his balls in play came off at 95 mph or above, but he ran a groundball rate of nearly 55% and some proprietary, Statcast-y expected stats I've sourced indicate he overperformed on paper in 2019. But, as I tend to do, I'm betting on a) athleticism and b) feel to hit, both of which Thomas has shown for nearly a half-decade now. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>","Bo9Wh47-Wm4","sa3006892"

A big part of how they're layered throughout the tier is based on which ones I think are more likely to grow into some pop, which is why the 21-year-old Perdomo is near the top. Suitable range bolstered by his instincts, and plus feet, actions, and arm utility make him a potential plus defender at short. His feel for the strike zone and bat-to-ball ability from the left side of the plate (his right-handed swing is bad) will be sufficient for low-end everyday duty, but relevant power might be coming. Perdomo's exit velos climbed throughout 2019. He averaged about 80 mph off the bat at Low-A, then about 82 mph after his promotion to Hi-A, and finally averaged 87 mph during a limited Fall League sample. His body has become more mature, and his left-handed swing has become more explosive and now features an overhead, helicopter finish similar to Miguel Andújar's even though Perdomo's physicality really hasn't changed at all. There's still some room for improvement as it relates to his lower half usage in the swing, and it's possible Perdomo scraps hitting right-handed altogether at some point. The skills/instincts foundation here is solid enough to project Perdomo as a low-end regular, and the burgeoning physical ability means he's begun to look like more than that. <em>(Alternate site)</em>","wS1NAke5r2E","22799"

Over two years at Miami (he was a draft-eligible sophomore), his arm strength returned, and Cecconi was once again living in the mid-90s while incorporating a slider with variable shape (it has very nasty two-plane break when it's well-located), and a lesser (but viable) change and cutter during the very brief 2020 college season. Either time or pro development unlocked yet nastier stuff during Cecconi's summer and Fall instructs outings. Sources from both inside and outside Arizona's org saw Cecconi sitting 94-96 and touching 98 with two breaking balls that were more-consistent looking than they were when he was in college; he had feel for both of them.

Due to a deep veteran staff at Texas A&M and his own inconsistency, Martin only really pitched for part of one season as a starter while he was in college. A lot of teams thought he was just going to be a reliever. The Astros popped him in the second round of the 2017 draft, hoping to tease out the traits they saw on the Cape, and in the two years he was in the org, they did it. Martin was a top 100 prospect before his elbow blew out in June of 2019, and he was included as part of the trade for Zack Greinke during his rehab.
Healthy Martin sits in the mid-90s, mixes in a hard, upper-80s slider, has an above-average power changeup, a more vertically-oriented curveball, and has at least average command. The timing of his surgery made it hard for him to return during the 2020 regular season, and instead he pitched toward the end of the alt site run and during instructs, sitting 92-95 in those outings. That's a shade beneath where he was pre-injury, when Martin sat 93-96 and was touching 98, and even at that velocity it was only playing like an average pitch. Folks in baseball consider Martin the sort of cat who's going to get the most out of himself, and with a return to his normal velocity, I think that will be a 2 WAR starter. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>","BAl3Ndom_Es","19884"

He was ultra projectable, an above average athlete, and already had a plus curveball. He also had feel for a changeup and command, and his fastball has life that enables it to compete for swings and misses in the zone even though it isn't all that hard yet. He was up to 94 in the 2019 AZL after he signed and was the same at the 2020 alternate site, sitting 90-92. Then Walston came out of the gate throwing harder during instructs before his velocity backed off into the low-90s again. Had he held that kind of velo throughout the Fall, Waltson would be on the Top 100 list. 
How Walston develops physically, and how those gains counterbalance the coming full-season workload, will dictate when he rises and how much. But he's really just consistent, impact velocity away from being a very good pitching prospect, and velocity is the thing the industry is becoming the best at developing. Walston's secondary/command foundation gives him a chance to end up with three plus pitches and command. He's as risky as any teenage pitching prospect, perhaps riskier when you consider the velocity fluctuations he has now shown since high school. One scout's upward trajectory is another's recency bias. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>","en2HeqBMVS4","sa3011814"

His high-maintenance delivery is hard to repeat, but it also makes things awkward for hitters, who don't typically see this kind of arm slot/release point. Even though it has changed a little bit in pro ball (Jameson's weight sits on his rear leg for longer, his knee bend is deeper now than before, and he lands more open than he did in college), it's still a tough look for hitters, especially righties, who are often frozen by his breaking stuff. Jameson was consistently into the upper-90s during 2020 instructs, and he manipulates the shape of two good breaking balls and flashes an occasional plus changeup. The delivery may make it hard for him to start, and Jameson has a skinny, atypical frame. Some teams think he'll end up in relief, but it may be in a multi-inning or high-leverage role, and he's held velo deep into games as a starter, so he has a shot to stick. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em>","Npwp2kmfTQI","sa3011652"

From a pitch movement demarcation standpoint, Jarvis does things a lot of progressive teams really like, and his slider is likely to perform above its raw grade because of how well it's located. His changeup will need to be located as consistently to be an impact pitch.

The Diamondbacks will try to develop Nelson as a starter and hope consistency in that role will help him develop viable control/command, which he lacked in the Fall of 2020 as he worked in the 93-96 range.

He was also pitching with a much shorter arm action at the alt site than he was in 2019. Accentuating components (he generates huge extension, which helps create flatter angle, and his fastball has backspin) already made Henry's seemingly pedestrian fastball viable, but the new arm action might bolster command and help him avoid the dips in velo he's sometimes dealt with in the past, when his delivery was uglier and more violent. 
Even though his arm action is much shorter, Henry's fastball command is still pretty spotty (which is fine -- it's a vertically-oriented heater) but his feel for locating all of his secondary pitches is much better. His breaking balls include a mid-80s slider and upper-70s curveball that have two distinct shapes. The curveball has more consistent impact depth and sweep than his slider, but he used the slider most often at the alt site. Henry's changeup is command dependent, and while it's not always located competitively it's almost never in the fat part of the zone. Even some of the cambios he mis-releases have accidental cut/slide and can generate awkward swings. I'm a little less scared of injury now that Henry's arm action has been cleaned up, and his stuff suggests he's a lower-variance No. 4/5 starter. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>","yyP4LGvLFCU","sa3011673"

I think it's a viable big league pitch but not an impact one. Instead, Tabor will need to lean on his secondary stuff (and command thereof) to miss big league bats. I've seen plus changeups and average breaking balls from Tabor. He'll need to hit the command grade I have projected for him, but he is tracking like a low-variance No. 4/5 starter.

Sometimes it backs up on Kelly and has changeup movement; it doesn't matter. When executed, it's a big league out pitch right now.

Frías has a vertical arm slot but his fastball has sink/tail, so it doesn't blow hitters away at the letters even though Frías throws it 94-98. The curveball has vertical depth and eats up hitters who are cheating on the velo, and it's a great first-pitch change of pace because of its depth.

It's an odd athletic trend for someone who was once a decorated amateur swimmer, since swimmers are generally ultra sinewy and lean. It is common for baseball players whose bodies mature early to also start declining early, at least in my anecdotal experience, and this is true of Beer, who was on the scouting radar very early as an old-for-his-grad-year (we really need a word for this) underclassman. Instead of reclassifying and entering the 2015 draft as an 18-year-old, Beer skipped his high school senior year completely and enrolled early at Clemson. He went on to have one of the best freshman years in college baseball history: .369/.535/.700 with 18 homers, 62 walks, and 27 strikeouts. 
In the few years since, Beer has continued to perform, albeit with his numbers slowly trending down as he reached his draft year at Clemson, then pro ball for a year with Houston before they shipped him to Arizona as part of the Zack Greinke trade. He's now 24 and has a .294/.388/.508 career line in the minors. He reached Double-A in his first pro season. These are all good signs, and Beer will be a solid big league role player relatively soon.

On the day before his 18th birthday, Martinez threw an inning of AZL ball and bumped 98 on the Chase Field radar gun.

The D-backs need to work on getting Martinez behind the baseball so his fastball doesn't have cut action (it's not enough cut to be impactful, it's just running into barrels, as you can see on our high speed video of Martinez) and instead has ride.
