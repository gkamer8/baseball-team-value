I saw him up to 101 mph in his first start of the year when he threw a lot of well-located sliders in the 89-92 mph range and struck out several Oregon Ducks. But his stuff and command waned later in the outing, which gave me relief-risk concern, though I should have realized the context for the look (it was his first outing of the season) was likely at play. He proceeded to dismantle TCU (10 K in 5.2 IP), North Carolina (CG, 1 BB, 14 K), and Utah (8 IP, 15 K) in the following three weeks before the shutdown, mostly with the fastball/slider combo, though he did flash a good changeup on occasion, too. Fold in some of the peripheral projection elements I like to bet on (Meyer was also an important offensive player in college, he's a great on-mound athlete, and he's coming from a cold weather school) and you can go nuts projecting on the things (mostly the changeup, command, and in-start stamina) that complete what could be a front-end profile. <em>(Alternate site)</em>","k7_4XDiW_aE","sa3014430"

Healthy Bleday was not only one of the more polished hitters in his draft class but one of the most physically gifted as well. In addition to having a superlative feel for the strike zone, Bleday is also short to the ball but still creates lift. He murders offspeed stuff, has all-fields ability, and can mishit balls with power -- a complete offensive package. He's also pretty fast, and his instincts in the outfield could make him a plus corner defender. I expect him to move pretty quickly and be an above-average everyday player. Even though it's dictated by circumstance (the pandemic), it feels odd to write that about a 23-year-old who has played just 38 pro games. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>","iRAJu_0OJhc","sa3011642"

Recall that Miami brought him back gingerly in 2019 after he had an injury-riddled '18; he first dealt with neck/shoulder issues, then elbow, then neck/shoulder again. Shoulder issues once again popped up during 2021 spring training and have run into the start of the regular season. These issues are part of why I'm a little lower on Sixto on the overall top 100 than the public tends to expect. The other reason is because of his fastball's shape. Some of my previously-held concerns about the playability of Sánchez's fastball (it's really hard, but only generated an 8% swinging strike rate on its own against 2019 minor leaguers; the big league average on all pitches is 11%) were allayed by him developing a second type of heater. He now has a pretty well-defined four- and two-seam variants, and good arm-side command of the two-seamer. In aggregate, he still missed bats at a rate just below league average, but he also generated a ton of weak groundballs with his fastballs, so I still consider the pitch to be plus.
His changeup, which had been one of the better ones in the minors for a while, will continue to be his primary out pitch. It has bat-missing, screwball action, so much that it dips beneath the barrel of right-handed hitters as well as away from lefties. Sánchez can also run it back over the glove-side corner of the plate for looking strikes. Though his slider has plus spin, the shape and quality of its movement are variable and location-dependent. Sánchez's command, especially for someone who throws as hard as he does and who converted to pitching later than most others, is pretty advanced, and if he ends up with plus command of three good pitches (one of them great), he'll likely make some All-Star teams, but he slides just a tad because of his injury history and because I don't think his fastball can dominate consistently even though it has elite velocity. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>","OFHkPmNCPOI","19680"

But that twitch and violence, Jazz's awesome ability to uncoil his body from the ground up and rotate with incredible speed, the natural lift in his swing -- many of the things that make him whiff-prone also make him exciting, and give him a chance to be an impact offensive player who also plays a premium defensive position very well. His skillset is somewhere on the Chris Taylor/Javier Báez continuum of strikeout/power offensive profiles at a premium defensive position, though the low-end of his potential outcomes looks like Freddy Galvis: a plus-gloved shortstop who hits for power, but with an OBP around .300. 
I wanted to see another year of plus walk rates before declaring that to be a true part of the skillset (Chisholm walked 11% of the time in 2019, up from a career 8%), but the pandemic made that impossible and Jazz earned the everyday second base job in Miami with his 2021 spring performance. His power is real (a 91.4 mph average exit velo would put him in the top 40 of the majors, while 48% of his balls in play being over 95 mph would be in the top 30), the lift is there (he has a career groundball rate in the low 30% range and a 17 degree average launch angle according to a source), and Jazz is athletic enough to be a plus defender at shortstop. The contrast between Chisholm and the ultra-steady Miguel Rojas is very stark, and it will be interesting to see how Miami handles the dynamic there over the next couple of seasons. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>","ir2kVOIT4mE","20454"

Before he was shut down, though, his alt site pitch data indicated his changeup might have become an elite weapon. There are already folks in baseball who prefer Cabrera to fellow Marlin Sixto Sánchez because his breaking ball has more two-plane sweep than Sixto's lateral slider. Like Sánchez, Cabrera's fastball spin axis resides in a bat-missing Bermuda Triangle and it doesn't generate swings and misses even though it's very hard. While there's almost no strike-throwing relief risk here, there is some related to injury. In addition to his weird 2020 infection, Cabrera has dealt with a biceps nerve issue early in 2021, and only began playing catch again shortly before this list published. If healthy, he's likely to contribute to the big club in 2021 either as yet another young rotation piece or as a three-pitch relief weapon with huge stuff, which Miami sorely lacks at the back of their bullpen. <em>(Alternate site)</em>",,"sa920423"

All the other components -- rare lefty velocity, a plus changeup, plus command, an elite frame suggesting athletic longevity -- are here in a low-slot package that gives hitters fits.

Even at 17, this is a broad-shouldered, up-the-middle teenager who already has pretty impressive pop. Salas had ""the look"" at 2020 instructs, filling out a uniform as well as anyone in the 2020 Jupiter/West Palm contingent even though he was only 17. He puts on quite a show during BP, at least as a lefty hitter. His lefty cut has some length but also has serious, lift-inducing leverage, and Salas can put balls out to all fields. His righty swing is borderline unusable right now, but remember we're talking about a super young switch bat; he deserves time to hone that righty feel to hit. 
After instructs, Salas went to Venezuela to play winter ball against grown men and really struggled. The length in his swing was exposed and he K'd in about half of his at-bats. He saw time at both middle infield spots and all three outfield positions while in Venezuela. Because Salas is already filled out and seems very motivated to be in the weight room, he's not likely to stay at shortstop and has a better chance of leaning on his good hands and actions at second base. The swing-and-miss piece is scary. Heuristically, Salas and Cubs shortstop Reggie Preciado belong in the same FV bucket, but the mechanical length creates some distance for me. He could be a Top 100 prospect in a year or a giant swing-and-miss red flag might reveal itself on paper. Several players behind Salas on this list have more likely big league utility than he does, but almost none of them have his ceiling. <em>(Fall Instructional League, Venezuelan Winter League)</em>",,"sa3014690"

He hit .407/.538/.729 and had more walks than strikeouts during his career at Wright State but only hit an impressive sum of homers as a junior. It's likely teams' draft models discounted Burdick slightly due to his draft day age, which was well over 22, and the Marlins were able to pick him up for well under slot in the third round. He went out and crushed Low-A, with his triple slash line (.308/.407/.542) largely reinforced by his underlying data (.276/.366/.490) and visual reports. 
Almost all eyeball reports of Burdick begin with a remark about his physicality. His forearms are as thick as support beams and help him generate huge power; the closest contemporary body comp here is Tyler O'Neill. Even though Burdick is a thicker guy, he takes a pretty athletic swing that demands a lot of his balance through contact, but he never appears out of control, even when he's swinging his hardest. He sometimes strides open in a way that impacts his ability to cover the outer third of the plate and his bat path works in such a way that Burdick tends to shoot pitches in the middle of the zone the opposite way, which makes me kind of scared about whether he'll be able to turn on inner-half big league fastballs. Wright State has an excellent program and college baseball in the Midwest is quite good, but we are talking about a small-school and an old-for-the-level performer here, a 24-year-old who hasn't played above A-ball yet. But Burdick also has middle-of-the-order power and has begun to lay a foundation of excellent performance.

I've seen him sit 86-91 at times but he's been more 90-94 of late, aided by some mechanical funk and deception. Though his diving changeup is his best pitch, Neidert's most-deployed offering during his short big league career is his terse, mid-80s slider, which he commands with sniper-like precision to his glove side. He'll also dump in a mid-70s curveball on occasion, a pitch that has enough depth to work as a change of pace offering used to get ahead in counts.

He was at the 2020 alt site and got about 30 PA in the big leagues, the first of his career, then played pretty consistently for Toros del Este in the Dominican Winter League before a limited 2021 big league spring run due to a groin injury that shut him down in mid-March. He is a flawed but super-talented player with among the most electric bat speed in pro baseball and a huge lefty cut that produces some epic home runs, though probably not enough to make him an everyday player even though he's talented enough to be one. 
I, like much of the industry, am scared of corner-only prospects who clearly lack plate discipline, and Sánchez is one. He's run a 6.5% career walk rate and tends to get himself out by making poor swing decisions. Additionally, Sánchez's swing has not fully actualized for power (a seven degree average launch angle in 2019, a groundball rate around 50%), so he's fighting an uphill battle to get to his huge raw juice in games since he's either swinging at pitches he can't do anything with or failing to lift a lot of the ones he can. Despite this, Sánchez has performed statistically so far: he's a career .291/.337/.452 hitter, though he has begun to show cracks at Double-A and above, where he's slugging under .400 in 135 games. Again, if you watch Sánchez's bat speed, you'll find it ludicrous that he's not hitting for power. He hits balls very hard (50% of his 2019 balls in play were hit 95 mph or above) and he has feel for contact, just not for contact in the air. A pro scout recently said to me, ""The thing about hitting the ball really hard on the ground is that it's still really hard, and difficult to turn into an out.""

He has fairly advanced feel for a curveball and changeup, not just for a teenager this size but for a teenager, period. Perez doesn't have your typical teenager pitcher's body/velocity projection. Indeed, he's such a rare case that the range of outcomes is tough to have a natural feel for. Sure, he might fill out and throw super hard but it also feels like there are also some pitchability, Doug Fister-type outcomes that could occur, too. Regardless, I think you have to take him over Dax Fulton (who follows him on this list) since Perez is a year and a half younger, hasn't had a surgery, has been seen throwing in actual games more recently, and has better body composition than Fulton. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3014807"

He struggled more than was hoped during his draft year, too, especially against SEC pitching (.222/.353/.315), but the raw power/straight line speed combo enticed Miami at pick 35 anyway. His post-draft summer wasn't great, as Misner failed to hit for power in the Midwest League. Fast forward a little over a year and Misner's swing remains the same (if there's been a subtle change then I'm missing it), which means he'll be limited to damaging mistakes made in the middle of the strike zone like he was in college. Because he can play a pretty good center field, there's a world in which Misner has a substantial big league role even with an incomplete offensive profile, it's just probably one closer to the 1.5 WAR area. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em> ",,"sa3011656"

Built like an NFL tight end, Encarnacion starts with a closed stance and opens his front side up toward the third base line as he strides. How far he opens depends upon pitch location, which can leave him lunging at breaking balls that he thinks are center cut and end up swirling away from him. But Encarnacion has the power to hit balls out the opposite way, even if he's fooled, if the pitch catches enough of the plate. He's sometimes a bit of an adventure in the outfield and the Marlins gave him reps at first base during 2021 spring training, which did not go well.

There's a big gap between Nunez's present physicality and how strong he'll need to be to make hard big league contact (his left-handed swing is behind the right), but his move forward is athletic, he rotates, and there's barrel accuracy from the right side already and enough footspeed to put pressure on opposing defenses. He was very late on everything he swung at during his brief 2021 big league spring training glimpses.

Díaz is a plus athlete, which is incredible for someone his size, and his infield feet, hands, and actions are all plus as well. He has a low hand load and a bat path geared for hitting breaking balls and low pitches, and over the course of watching him in the big leagues and at length during his time playing for Estrellas Orientales, I'm pretty scared that big league arms will be able to get him out with velocity at the top of the strike zone.

He had a ten-strikeout start in his first 2021 minor league outing then was immediately promoted to the big league team. It's surprising that Poteet had such a late bump in velocity. His era of UCLA pitcher had already adopted Driveline principals, and I would have guessed he was already maxed out. Of his three secondaries, Poteet most-often deploys his changeup, a heavy, sinking offering in the 85-88mph range. His slider has more linear, diagonal movement than two-planed sweeping shape, but it can still miss bats away from righty batters.  His curveball has plus-plus spin rates but is easy to identify out of Poteet's hand since he has a sink/tail-oriented fastball.

Pop's slider has length, though what looks like early break to my eye provides an early in-flight tell, and hitters seem able to pick it up pretty well. Unless Pop develops feel for locating his sinker just below the knees with greater consistency, this well-located slider will need to act as his putaway pitch.

The strikeouts continued in Low-A but, boy, does Conine have mood-altering power.

The issue is that he'll probably end up being a DH. He's also a softer, top-heavy athlete with bulky shoulders who you could argue has some reverse projection. He's only 20, after all.
