"Jazz Chisholm","MIA","SS","AA",33,1,,"55",2021,,"22.4527777","5' 11""","165","L","R",2015,"J2","ARI",200000,"Bahamas","The Marlins seem to have a taste for divisive, polarizing prospects who much of the industry perceives as risky, such as Lewis Brinson, Sandy Alcantara, Magneuris Sierra, and many more of the names currently on this list. That includes Jazz, who was acquired in exchange for Zac Gallen before the trade deadline. The swap meant Miami gave up six years of what looks like a mid-rotation starter for six-ish years of Chisholm, who might be a superstar or strikeout too much to be anything at all. 
Chisholm has whiffed in 30% of his career plate appearances, partially a product of a sophomoric approach to hitting and otherwise due to him arguably being too explosive for his own good. But that twitch, the violence, Jazz's awesome ability to uncoil his body from the ground up and rotate with incredible speed, the natural lift in his swing -- many of the things that make him whiff-prone also make him exciting, and give him a chance to be an impact offensive player who also plays a premium defensive position. His skillset is somewhere on the Chris Taylor/Javier Báez continuum of strikeout/power offensive profiles at a premium defensive position. We want to see another year of plus walk rates (Chisholm walked 11% of the time in 2019, up from a career 8%) before we declare that to be a true part of the skillset, but the power is real (a 91.4 mph average exit velo would put him in the top 40 of the majors, while 48% of his balls in play being over 95 mph would be in the top 30), the lift is there (he has a career groundball rate in the low 30% range and a 17 degree average launch angle according to a source), and we think he has a chance to be an above-average defensive shortstop, though for the first time we had one dissenting source on the glove. He also performed statistically as a 21-year-old at Double-A. One of several radionuclides in this system, Chisholm has its highest ceiling.","ir2kVOIT4mE","sa919327"
"Sixto Sanchez","MIA","RHP","AA",50,2,,"50",2020,,"21.9583333","6' 0""","200","R","R",2014,"J2","PHI",35000,"Dominican Republic","Miami had Sixto throw in Extended Spring Training (he threw bullpens until mid-April, then got into games) to control his season-long workload coming off an injury-plagued 2018 (he had visible discomfort in his neck and shoulder early in the year, elbow soreness later on, and skipped Fall League due to collarbone soreness) before sending him to Double-A for the bulk of the summer. There is a gap between how many bats his fastball misses (he has 8% swinging strike rate on the heater, where the big league average on all pitches is 11%) and what you might expect at this velocity (Sixto averages 97, touches 101) because it has sinking/tailing movement rather than ride. Whether Miami player dev can adjust that without compromising Sanchez's control and health remains to be seen. 
His changeup, which is one of the better ones in the minors, will be his primary out pitch unless or until that happens. The cambio has bat-missing, screwball action, so much that it dips beneath the barrel of right-handed hitters as well as away from lefties. Sanchez can also run it back over the corner of the glove side of the plate, freezing perplexed hitters. Though his slider has plus spin, it's horizontal wipe means it needs to be located off the plate to work, but Sixto, especially considering how little he's pitched in his life and how far backwards his build has gone on him to this point, commands it pretty well. The same arm slot/hand position change that might add more ride to the fastball could add more depth to the breaking ball, but you could argue that such a change is an unnecessary risk considering Sixto's injury history and how well everything already works. 
Knowledge of the fastball efficacy gap combined with the injury history has us down on Sixto a little bit. He still has top-of-the rotation upside, there's just more developmental work to do to get there than we thought there was a year ago.","OFHkPmNCPOI","sa873550"

Healthy Bleday was not only one of the more polished hitters in his draft class but one of the most physically gifted as well. In addition to having a superlative feel for the strike zone, Bleday is also short to the ball but still creates lift. He murders offspeed stuff, has all-fields ability, and can mishit balls with power -- he's a complete offensive package. He's also pretty fast, and his instincts in the outfield could make him a plus corner defender. We expect him to move pretty quickly and be an above-average everyday player.","iRAJu_0OJhc","sa3011642"

Every once in a while, everything comes together and we end up with a top 100 prospect, and that is exactly what is happening with Cabrera. A slight velo bump and an arm slot change enabled a 2019 ascension (he had strikeout rates around 20% in '17 and '18, and roughly 30% in '19) as Cabrera's breaking ball now has more downward action. There are clubs who have Cabrera ahead of Sixto on their Marlins org pref list because they prefer Cabrera's breaking ball and the movement profile on his fastball. His stuff, build, and likely No. 4 starter profile compare pretty closely to the college pitchers who typically go in the top 10 picks of any given draft, and Cabrera has now shown he's capable of making relevant adjustments without experiencing hiccups in performance, which portends success in future trials.",,"sa920423"
"Jesus Sanchez","MIA","RF","AAA",102,5,,"50",2020,,"22.7694444","6' 2""","230","L","R",2014,"J2","TBR",400000,"Dominican Republic","Two of the trades Tampa Bay made last summer -- swapping Nick Solak for Peter Fairbanks and Jesus Sanchez for Nick Anderson -- made us wonder if we were undervaluing long-tethered, potential late-inning relievers, or at least underestimating their value to immediate contenders or perhaps the impact of 40-man crunch on trade leverage. 
It also made us worry we were too high on Sanchez himself. We, and much of the industry, are scared of corner-only prospects who clearly lack plate discipline, and Sanchez is one of these (6.5% career walk rate). That, plus Sanchez's swing still not being fully actualized for power (a seven degree launch angle in 2019, a groundball rate around 50%), means he's fighting an uphill battle to get to his huge raw power in games, since he's either swinging at pitches he can't do anything with or failing to lift a lot of the ones he can. However, Sanchez has some of the most thrilling bat speed in the minors and despite his issues, his talent has enabled him to perform statistically so far. He hits balls very hard (50% of his 2019 balls in play were hit 95 mph or above) and has feel for contact, just not for contact in the air. We think it'll be enough for Sanchez to be an average everyday hitter, and the Marlins have two option years to try to tinker with the swing and coax out more power if they want to. There's All-Star ceiling here if they can do it.","_blAwKOM3jg","sa872787"

In his first full season with more of a contact-oriented approach, he cut his strikeout rate from 37% to 30% amid a move to Triple-A, and posted an average statline for the PCL. He hits the baseball very hard -- a 93.4 mph average exit velo, per a source, with 52% of his balls in play at or above 95 mph -- but not often in the air. We expect what comes from this newfound approach to contact, as well as Harrison's defensive ability, to result in an average everyday player in aggregate, but the swing-and-miss tendencies, as well as the possibility that Harrison has some huge seasons if he ever hits for power, mean he's a high-variance player.","BW5Y0A3EeuI","sa828691"

Over time, he was able to add muscle and not only recapture the power he had early in his pro career -- resulting in a 2019 offensive renaissance -- but to do so while retaining the slick defensive ability he flashed as an amateur before he got big. 
Diaz is a plus athlete, which is incredible for someone his size, and his infield feet, hands, and actions are all plus. He has a low hand load and a bat path geared for hitting pitches down, so we wonder if big league arms will be able to get him out at the top of the strike zone, but Diaz generally has good feel to hit, he can adjust to breaking balls mid-flight, and he impacts the ball in the air to all-fields. We think he's a .340 xwOBA guy who also plays plus defense at first, and while ideally he'd be a little more selective, we still think he ends up as a good everyday first baseman.","b6BzJGKnQbI","sa828420"

He proceeded to dismantle TCU (10 K in 5.2 IP), North Carolina (CG, 1 BB, 14 K), and Utah (8 IP, 15 K) in the following three weeks before the shutdown, mostly with the fastball/slider combo. Meyer's stuff and command has backed up later in starts and he doesn't have a fully formed starter's mix yet, but he's arguably the best athlete among college starters in this class.",,

The low-80s slurve is still not great and has been usurped by a mid-80s cutter/slider that, considering how quickly Rogers' fastball/changeup control have developed, should enable him to induce weak contact as he hones it. The lack of a traditional breaking ball will likely be a barrier to true mid-rotation performance, and it's more likely that, if Rogers is ever to be a No. 3/4 starter, he does so via continued improvement of a hopefully elite changeup or command, rather than the unlikely addition of a viable breaking ball.","EgPQVpXhSuU","sa3005423"

The first was during his first pro summer, when Miami promoted him and other recent prep draftees to Low-A for the end of the season. Scott was bad there at the end of 2018, but made adjustments and posted a league-average statline as a 19-year-old in the Midwest League the following year. Scott kept his head above water at Hi-A late in 2019, too, though he did swing and miss much more there. Scott shares some swing components with fellow Plant High School alum Kyle Tucker; he has a similar low-ball proclivity and has shown glimpses of all-fields power. Scott's frame is broad in the shoulders but otherwise narrow throughout, so he may never grow into big strength, which just makes him more likely to retain his plus speed. Unless unforeseen feel for lift develops, Scott profiles as a table-setting center fielder.","0xcsCdAtkPM","sa3008080"

At his best, Garrett was living in the low-90s and locating his quality breaking ball to his glove side, which gave him two weapons against right-handed hitters (the changeup is also good) and a finisher versus lefties. His arm action is still short and efficient, same as it was before the surgery, and his pre-injury velocity is back. This isn't an impact fastball profile, but the quality of the secondaries and Garrett's command should enable him to pitch toward the back of a rotation.","m1S8r6P_0gU","sa917923"

He struggled more than was hoped during his draft year, too, especially against SEC pitching (.222/.353/.315), but the raw power/straightline speed combo enticed Miami at pick 35 anyway.

Built like an NFL tight end, Encarnacion starts with a closed stance and opens his front side up toward the third base line as he strides. How far he opens depends upon pitch location, which can leave him lunging at breaking balls that he thinks are center cut and end up swirling away from him, but Encarnacion has the power to hit balls out the opposite way, even if he's fooled, if the pitch catches enough of the plate. He's sometimes a bit of an adventure in the outfield, but even among polished peers in the Fall League, Encarnacion's strength and physicality was a cut above, and he should mash his way into a modest big league role within the next couple of years.",,"sa943817"

Even though Burdick is a thicker guy, he takes a pretty athletic swing that demands a lot of his balance through contact, but he never appears out of control, even when he's swinging his hardest. We tend not to buy heavily into college hitters' stats at lower levels, but we know more about Burdick's measurable power now that he's generated data in pro ball, and it indicates that he might be a four or five-hole masher.",,"sa3009876"

There's a big gap between Nunez's present physicality and how strong he'll need to be to make hard big league contact (his left-handed swing is behind the right), but his move forward is athletic, he rotates, there's barrel accuracy from the right side already, and enough footspeed to make balls in play a bit of a problem.

We speculated he'd move to the outfield before the draft but our sources who saw him in the fall think it's more likely he ends up at third base. 
We still know next to nothing about Johnson's approach or feel for the strike zone because he hasn't played much pro ball, and that's going to be more important if he indeed ends up at a corner, but there's a chance for big offensive impact here because of the bat speed and Johnson's ability to rotate.

He went to Hi-A and had a putrid season, slashing .252/.295/.283 (not a typo) before an unwarranted promotion to Double-A; Mesa was also poor in the Fall League. The length of his swing prevents him from getting on plane with the baseball and hitting for any power, though he does have pretty good feel for the barrel. He's a good center field defender with a laser arm, and he appears to be a plus runner out there, though Mesa is already notoriously difficult to get max-effort run times out of. We still think there's a chance for Victor Victor to be a fourth outfielder, but something with the swing needs to change to enable more in-game power or there will just be better bench outfield candidates hanging around.","K7KQgt1ZsuU","sa3008602"
