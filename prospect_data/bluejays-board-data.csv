"Nate Pearson","TOR","SP","AAA",9,1,,"60",2021,"High","24.7916666","6' 6""","245","R","R",2017,"Draft","TOR",2450000,"Central Florida JC (FL)","After a healthy 2019, albeit one during which he was asked to work just four innings per start, Pearson once again had an injury hiccup in 2020. This time his malady, described as right elbow tightness, was actually arm-related after he had previously dealt with an intercostal strain and a fractured ulna caused by a comebacker. The Blue Jays shut him down for about a month, and when Pearson returned he did so as a reliever. Upon coming back, his fastball velocity was not only intact but he threw harder than he did as a starter before he was shut down (he averaged 99 mph after ""only"" throwing 96 as a starter). After just one post-injury regular season outing, Pearson came out of the bullpen in the final game of Toronto's Wild Card round loss to the Rays, and absolutely paved over Tampa Bay hitters who had just shelled Hyun Jin Ryu. The question the industry hoped Pearson would answer in 2020 was, ""Can this guy hold upper-90s cheese all year, every fifth day, as a starter?"" I think the answer to that is probably no, and I also think that based on how difficult it's been for him to build a starter's inning count in the minors, Pearson might spend his first couple of big league seasons in some kind of truncated starter's role or as a multi-inning relief weapon. 
But he does have front-end stuff in his fastball and mid-80s slider, which is often a 70 on the scale. Pearson also walked a bunch of hitters during his 2020 debut but his in-zone location rate was about the big league average, and he pretty consistently executes his fastball and slider where they should be located, so I think it's unlikely he moves to the 'pen for command-related reasons. He also has a curveball and changeup that round out the starter-worthy repertoire, though he's never really been able to throw that curveball for strikes and I'd speculate that the changeup ends up as the tertiary pitch here. His changeup flashes plus but his feel for locating it consistently isn't great, and I think that pitch needs to develop if he's going to max out as a starter. Because FV is a WAR-based prediction and Pearson's innings are likely to be somewhat limited early in his career, perhaps I should have kept his FV in the 55 tier even though he returned from the elbow injury with his usual velocity. But I'm 60'ing him here because of his high-end outcomes, which I think also include a truly elite relief possibility. There's a chance Toronto eventually does with him what the Reds did with Aroldis Chapman, where the team is competitive and Pearson is thriving in a relief role, so they just leave him there. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>","t_D8-uewjYw","20160"
"Austin Martin","TOR","CF","AA",43,2,,"55",2022,"Med","22.2","6' 0""","185","R","R",2020,"Draft","TOR",7000000,"Vanderbilt","This is a good time to remind readers that present hit tool grades are standardized. Martin's performance, especially late during his 2019 sophomore season, put him at or near the top of the 2020 draft class. He slashed .392/.486/.604 that year and, similar to but perhaps not as emphatically as Adley Rutschman the year before, asserted himself as his draft class' top college hitter. Then Martin came out for the shortened 2020 campaign and though his numbers (against mostly non-conference pitching) were strong, he did not look elite from an eyeball scouting perspective. He wasn't running as well as he had the year before, and he had issues throwing the ball from third to first base, necessitating a move to center field. The industry didn't have much time to assess his routes and instincts there before the shutdown, and his average early-season speed created some skepticism. During his career at Vanderbilt, Martin mostly played third (61 games), but also saw time in center (25 games, half of those as a freshman), and at first (22) and both middle infield spots (14). He continued playing all over the field during his post-draft time at the Blue Jays' alternate site. The low-end pre-draft opinions of Martin feared he'd end up in left field and that he'd be without enough power to support an everyday profile there. I think he's likely to play a couple different positions at a passable level, at least one up the middle (either second or center), and the portion of his offense that drove his amateur stock, namely his elite plate discipline and feel for contact, will carry him to production on par with an above-average regular, à la Ben Zobrist. Martin's swing decisions are fantastic, and the combination of selectivity and his gorgeous, natural swing loft give him an excellent chance of hitting for some power despite middling raw juice. <em>(Alternate site)</em>","lj0PqRkUMCs","sa3014454"

Regardless, he was sitting 90-92 as opposed to the 92-94, touch 97 from the year before, and I slid him back a spot on this list because of it, though I didn't change his FV in any way. In an alternate universe the thing I'd have hoped to glean from Woods Richardson's 2020 season was whether he had improved his ability to spin his four-seamer with better seam uniformity, something he struggled with the last time FanGraphs captured his pitches on Slowmie, our high speed camera. SWR works with both four- and two-seam variants, and also has the screwball action changeup that's now en vogue and a curveball that has good shape thanks to his arm slot but lacks power.  An athletic two-way high schooler, Woods Richardson was lauded a little extra because he's so competitive and works about as fast as any pitcher in the minors. There's still a viable three-pitch mix here but I'd like to see the velocity bounce back in 2021. <em>(Alternate site)</em>","AvmvGJtYR4c","sa3008423"
"Alejandro Kirk","TOR","C","MLB",75,4,,"50",2022,"High","22.5805555","5' 8""","265","R","R",2016,"J2","TOR",30000,"Mexico","Kirk has several elite statistical indicators, both in his surface-level on-field performance and in the background TrackMan data from his 2019 minor league campaign (in addition to what I have over on The Board, a source tells me his expected stats based on quality of contact are very similar to his 2019 Hi-A slash line of .288/.395/.446), and eyeball scouts acknowledge he's a terrific offensive player. 
But there is skepticism surrounding his long-term athletic viability because Kirk is a very husky guy (listed at 5-foot-8, 265) without a body comp precedent in baseball, or arguably across all of pro sports. Because Christian Vazquez is listed at 5-foot-9, 205 (which is either an embarrassing oversight or an intentional lie), the closest measurable comp to Kirk is José Molina at 5-foot-10, 250, but that's from when Molina was nearly 40-years-old, whereas Kirk is only 22. It's very difficult to anticipate what might happen to his frame as he enters his mid-20s, when many other players are thickening up as they reach maturity. All of this creates doubt surrounding whether or not Kirk can catch right now and/or long-term. But because he made his major league debut in 2020, we've gotten to see him do it a handful of times, and for a lot of different pitchers, at the big-league level. Kirk's receiving and framing are okay. He catches on one knee even with runners on base, which makes him especially good at framing balls toward the bottom of the zone. He sets his target then lets his glove hand go slack and works back to the ball as it heads home, which magnifies issues with visual presentation to umpires when his pitcher misses his spot. In general, Kirk just has a slow-moving glove and doesn't catch pitches at the top of the zone as cleanly as the softy sinkers at the bottom, and I wonder if he'll have more obvious issues catching power arms, though he did fine in two outings as Robbie Ray's backstop. Kirk's legs set up as wide as they can go when he's in his modified crouch so he can try to block balls without actually having to move his whole body laterally, and it actually works okay. He's not a great thrower despite an average arm because he's so slow out of his crouch, and sometimes he'll throw from one knee to circumvent this. 
My visual evaluation is that he's a passable defender, not a good one, and I think the Jays deep stable of catchers will dictate that he DHs sometimes and catches at others. The more 1B/DH Kirk has to play during his years of team control, the less valuable he'll be. He has an all-fields, doubles-oriented approach that prioritizes contact and walks, which I think is great for a catcher but won't be at first. He's an everyday big league catcher right now, but he may have an abnormally early decline phase. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>",,"22581"

Then he went to the alternate site, which was certainly a huge leap in pitcher quality compared to what he faced in Low-A, but he was also seeing the same group of arms over and over again, and there's no way of knowing how that impacted the performance reflected in data shared with other teams. The nearly two-year layoff hasn't caused me to downgrade Groshans so much as he has just been passed by hitters in whom I have a higher degree of confidence. The tools package here, arguably a Josh Donaldson starter kit with similar swing mechanics, still gives Groshans a pretty huge ceiling if he can actually hit like he did for the first month of 2019. He's a big-framed, well-made athlete with enough arm strength and mobility that some teams thought he could be tried at shortstop in pro ball. Part of that is because his arm strength might enable him to hide some of what he lacks in lateral range, and he did moonlight at shortstop at the alt site. I think he ends up as a power-hitting third baseman but the risk profile here has gone up due to the layoff. <em>(Alternate site)</em>","f-TuuK1yB5k","sa3006893"

At the time, he ranked (at least here at FG) behind a number of players in his class because of concerns about his contact skills, and those concerns remain due to wild variation in the way Martinez's lower half works during his swing. His footwork is all over the place and he takes a lot of ugly hacks. But the bat speed, and Martinez's ability to rotate, is pretty special and rare for a potential middle infielder. He projects to have at least 60 raw power, and he should stick somewhere in the infield, but this is a kid with a high-variance hit tool who is therefore high-variance. <em>(Alternate site for a couple weeks, Fall Instructional League)</em>","yHLBXVb004Y","sa3010692"

You can't fake an 11% strikeout rate, though, which was especially impressive considering he made that much contact as a teenager in full-season ball. Even though he is young, I thought it was unlikely Moreno would develop much more raw power, both because catching takes such a physical toll on the body that it often dilutes offensive production, and because Moreno is a smaller-framed young man. But his max exit velos at the 2020 alt site were up above what they were in 2019, which appears to be the result of added mass rather than a swing alteration. It's an encouraging sign and part of a pretty impressive 2020 for Moreono during which he was seen on alt site video, during instructs, and then later in the Venezuelan Winter League, where he hit .373/.471/.508. I think the length of his year is as close as any catching prospect has come to being forced to replicate an actual full season behind the dish in 2020.  Defensively, he catches on one knee until there are runners on or there are two strikes, then sets up really wide in his crouch regardless of the pitch coming, which prevents runners from being able to signal pitch type to the hitter. He can sometimes be preoccupied with framing and whiff on a pitch he should be able to handle, but he's a capable if unspectacular defender and framer. Even with the little extra juice, Moreno's offensive profile is still all about hand-eye/bat-to-ball, punching airborne contact to all fields. He does enough of that to project as an everyday catcher. The Jays were compelled to add him to their 40-man this offseason, and he's one of five catchers they have rostered, making Moreno a potential trade chip if the competitive Blue Jays want to add to their roster. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional league, Venezuelan Winter League)</em>","IZ-QYT1uaCQ","sa3003226"

Once softer and relatively unathletic, he's transformed himself from a high-effort relief type into a potential workhorse mid-rotation starter. 
Manoah still leads with his fastball/slider combo, and remains hulking and somewhat stiff-looking. That power fastball/slider approach to pitching and the Sal Romano body comp creates an air of bullpen risk, but that was the case with Nate Pearson once upon a time, and isn't anymore. Manoah can back foot his slider against lefties and his changeup flashed average in college, so he has a foundation of platoon-fighting weapons at his disposal, and changeup development was the focal point of his alternate site activity. He showed no ill effects from a big innings increase from 2018 to 2019 and was still 93-96 with his heater late in the summer after he signed; he continued to pitch in the mid-90s during the summer of 2020. Changeup and command consistency will reinforce the mid-rotation forecast, which is currently a right-tail outcome rather than the likeliest one, making those the things to look for when he pitches in 2021. <em>(Alternate site)</em>","xjl8MA97TKA","26410"

He has a short, high-effort swing, and his hands load high and take a curt, direct path to the ball with plus bat speed that Hiraldo generates with effort and violence. It's a swing-happy, pull-heavy approach to contact that would ideally become more polished, but there's rare bat speed and vertical plate coverage here, so Hiraldo has a talent-based shot to both hit and hit for power. Like Moreno, he also had a fairly relevant uptick in his high-end exit velocities in the Fall, on par with what Riley Adams was capable of in 2019, now tied for the highest in the system.
Hiraldo is stocky and strong in general, let alone for his age, and even though he's playing lots of shortstop right now, I think he'll end up as a shift-aided second or third baseman at physical maturity.

Then he needed surgery before the 2018 season began, was traded that year as part of the Josh Donaldson rental deal, and wasn't back until late in 2019 as a reliever, when he looked ready to make an immediate bullpen impact, sitting 95-97 (up from 93-96) with his fastball in the Arizona Fall League. He threw harder still when the 2020 season finally rolled around, parked at 96-99 and touching 100. Toward the very end of the season he was once again shut down with elbow tendinitis. It's concerning that over the last several years, Merryweather has been healthy and pitching in games for just a few weeks. But he has knockout backend bullpen stuff right now, and for a lot of prospects in this and other systems, that would be a great outcome.

Industry folks tend to think that prospects like this were the sort most harmed by the cancellation of the 2020 minor league season since it would have been ideal for Brown to have faced age- and skill-appropriate competition over the course of several months (probably in the Appy League) rather than go from zero-to-60 against relatively advanced pitching (certainly more advanced than a normal instructs) for a few weeks in the Fall. Alas, Brown looked overmatched at instructs even though his swing has become so minimalistic that it doesn't really take advantage of his athleticism. Still, his speed gives him a chance to be a dynamic center fielder, which takes a lot of pressure off the bat. As currently constituted, Brown's swing might enable him to be a bottom-of-the-order catalyst, though it's possible it's just a developmental checkpoint meant to help him develop a better feel for contact. He'll be a teenager for most of 2021 so we have plenty of time to find out. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3011717"

Yes, his 2019 numbers were likely aided by Lansing to some degree, but he does have great feel for contact (12% strikeout rate), which he's shown throughout his entire career, and he takes some pretty hellacious rips on occasion. Lacking impact power at present and the physical projection to anticipate it in the future, Lopez's realistic future role is that of a contact-oriented, multi-positional role player. It means Lopez will have to become a playable defender at short and (hopefully) center field, because without more power, he'll end up in the Eric Young Jr. roster fringe area. <em>(Fall Instructional League, LIDOM)</em>",,"sa3004268"

This is the type of prospect whose stock gets reinforced by strong on-paper performance and because Robertson's first full season was wiped out due to COVID, we don't have that. Instead he looked okay at instructs, showing pretty good plate coverage and an ability to go down and scoop balls toward the bottom of the zone. He has corner-worthy power, but it only plays in certain parts of the zone and it's tough to profile in a corner when that's the case.

His front leg would kick up, then come all the way back down and briefly make contact with the mound again before he'd stride toward home. Murphy's performance fell apart as he tried to make an adjustment that would satisfy the somewhat officious ruling, and he had some really rough starts in the middle of 2019 before getting hurt again toward the end of the year. Then there was a pandemic, which you may know. Healthy and working with a legal delivery during the summer of 2020, Murphy finally made his big league debut. He threw six innings across four relief appearances, and worked 94-98 and touched 99 with his fastball (which has sinker movement). His curveball is average, and Murphy throws lots of strikes.

He seems to have ditched his curveball in favor of a new cutter he deployed with great frequency during his best 2020 outing against Baltimore. His walk rates have slipped the last couple of years and his stuff doesn't afford him much margin for error in the zone, so now he looks like more of a spot starter than a consistent backend piece, but if his cutter turns out to be a real weapon then he's back in that backend starter bucket. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>","zBgqGOK79w4","19269"
