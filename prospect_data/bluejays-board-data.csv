I wasn't worried about Pearson being a true injury risk because his maladies (an intercostal strain, a fractured ulna due to a comebacker) have been unrelated to the typically concerning elbow and shoulder stuff. Instead, I wanted to see if he could hold his elite velo under the strain of a full-season workload, and what his secondary stuff would be like when he was forced to pitch through lineups multiple times. Not only did the velo hold water but Pearson's repertoire is very deep. Yes, he'll chuck 101 past you, but he'll also pull the string on a good changeup that runs away from lefty hitters, dump a curveball in for strikes to get ahead of you before gassing you with two strikes, and tilt in one of the harder sliders on the planet, a pitch I've personally seen him throw at 95 mph and that regularly sits in the low-90s. Does he need to throw well above 100 innings to be a true front-end arm? Yes, but that he was able to retain his stuff amid a huge innings increase in 2019 is a sign he'll be able to do so with even more innings folded in. A source with offseason intel tells me Pearson also remade his body and has gotten a little leaner. We won't truly know until he reports to camp, but if that's true, it bolsters my confidence in him sustaining this level of stuff for several years.","t_D8-uewjYw","sa3005097"

He already had two traits that together make for a strong profile in that Martin is likely to play a premium position (though where exactly is up for debate, his arm was not great early in 2020 and he moved from 3B to CF, but the shutdown prevented the industry from truly knowing if he fit there) and has a plus-plus feel for the strike zone. He had more walks than strikeouts as a sophomore and started hitting for power late in that season, something his combination of selectivity and gorgeous, natural swing loft give him an excellent chance of doing in pro ball despite middling raw juice. Martin doesn't have huge physical tools at first blush, but if the same feel and instincts that help him do literally everything else well also help him play center field, then he could be play there full time or as part of a multi-positional package that also includes some infield spots.

His vertically oriented release point makes it hard for him to work his fastball east and west, and several teams had him evaluated as a future reliever before the draft because they saw a lack of fastball command. But this vertical release also enables him to effectively change hitters' eye level by pairing fastballs up with breaking balls down, and he has a plus breaking ball. 
Woods Richardson works so quickly that it often makes hitters uncomfortable, though scouts love it. He's developed a better changeup in pro ball, pronating really hard to turn the thing over and create tailing movement. Though he was one of the 2018 draft's youngest prospects, his frame is pretty mature, so this is a player who might look a little too good on a pro scouting model.","AvmvGJtYR4c","sa3008423"

He comported himself well during a 23-game jaunt in the Midwest League (.337/.427/.482) before he was shut down with a left foot injury that kept him away from baseball activity until just after the New Year. The mystery and severity of the injury, combined with Lansing's tendency to caricature hitter's stats, has much of the industry in wait-and-see mode here, though the power is for real.","f-TuuK1yB5k","sa3006893"

We ranked him behind a number of players in his class because of concerns about his contact skills, and those remain due to wild variation in the way Martinez's lower half works during his swing. His footwork is all over the place and he takes a lot of ugly hacks. But the bat speed, Martinez's ability to rotate, is huge. He projects for at least 60 raw power, and he should stick somewhere in the infield, but this is a kid with a high-variance hit tool.","yHLBXVb004Y","sa3010692"

Once softer and relatively unathletic, he's transformed himself from a high-effort relief type into a possible workhorse mid-rotation starter. 
Manoah still leads with his fastball/slider combo, and remains hulking and somewhat stiff-looking. That power fastball/slider approach to pitching and the Sal Romano body comp creates an air of bullpen risk, but that was the case with Nate Pearson once upon a time, and isn't anymore. Manoah can back foot his slider against lefties and his changeup flashed averge in college, so he has platoon-fighting weapons at his disposal. He showed no ill effects from a big innings increase from 2018 to 2019 and was still 93-96 with his heater late in the summer after he signed. Changeup and command consistency will reinforce the mid-rotation forecast, which is currently a right-tail outcome rather than the likeliest one.","xjl8MA97TKA","sa3011725"
"Alejandro Kirk","TOR","C",,,7,,"45+",2022,,"21.6888888","5' 9""","265","R","R",2016,"J2","TOR",,"Mexico","A Jeremy Brown situation is brewing here, as Kirk has several elite statistical markers (a tiny 5% swinging strike rate, more career walks than strikeouts, power production in the FSL) and strong TrackMan data (a 91 mph average exit velo, a 48% hard hit rate), but also generates skepticism among eyeball scouts looking at athletes and bodies. Kirk is built like Chris Farley and, like Farley, has moments of surprising grace and athletic brilliance despite his size. But there's no precedent for someone this big having a robust major league career. The closest comp I could find from a height/weight standpoint is Jos√© Molina, who was listed at 6-feet, 250 pounds late in his career. Molina was nearly 40 then, while Kirk -- 5-foot-8, 265 pounds -- is only 21, and it's hard to predict what will happen to his build and agility as he ages into his 20s, because pro athletes like this (John Daly, maybe?) don't really exist. 
His age makes the statistical track record even more impressive, though, especially when you consider that Kirk missed a year due to a hand injury and has been young for every level at which he's raked. He has an all-fields, doubles-oriented approach that prioritizes contact and walks. He's a 20-grade waddler from base to base, and even visual evaluations of his swing (which features conservative footwork) are mixed despite his numbers. He can turn on balls in and hit balls hard the other way, but this isn't like Andrew Vaughn, who scouts will acknowledge has defensive limitations and whose mobility they'll knock, but about whose athleticism in the batter's box they all rave. This is a weird one, perhaps a prospect who will be aided by coming changes to the way balls and strikes are called in the event that he begins a physical regression very early, as most scouts believe he will.",,"sa3005337"

You can't fake an 11% strikeout rate, though, which was especially impressive considering Moreno made that much contact as a teenager in full-season ball. Even though he is young, it's relatively unlikely that he develops much more raw power, both because catching takes such a physical toll on the body that it often dilutes offensive production, and because Moreno is a smaller-framed young man. But I think there's a chance for relevant game power if he can rotate a little better, which might be accomplished if his stride were a little longer and enabled his front side to have more flex. 
Right now, Moreno's all hand-eye/bat-to-ball, punching airborne contact to all fields and running unusually well for a catcher. He has a shot to be a well-rounded, everyday backstop based on the contact and defensive projection (Moreno converted to the position around when he signed and hasn't been doing it for very long), even more so if he makes an adjustment that helps create more pop.","IZ-QYT1uaCQ","sa3003226"

UConn rode him hard during his junior year in Storrs. He faced 36 hitters in a March game the Huskies won 18-1. During conference tournament play, Kay threw a complete game, then pitched again during the tournament on three days rest; he threw 90 pitches amid an hour-long lightning delay. That heavy usage made it unsurprising when he blew out in the fall of 2016. 
When Kay finally returned, he looked markedly different than he did in college, when he was a lefty changeup monster with mediocre velocity. Kay's fastball ticked up and now sits at about 93 mph instead of peaking there, and his two-plane curveball got better. His once-dominant changeup regressed but is still comfortably average, and he has great feel for locating it down, and to his arm side. He was shut down late last year with a back/side issue, so perhaps there's some extra injury risk here, but otherwise this is a major league-ready, strike-throwing No. 4/5 starter look.","1aaC76-TmjE","20387"

He has premium fastball spin, and his heater's performance might take a leap with a slight axis change. I had previously misevaluated Hatch's control/command, which is clearly in a fairly stable, starter-friendly realm. He's also been remarkably durable. He repeated Double-A as a 24-year-old last year and his age dilutes his FV by a shade, but there are several major league-quality pitches here and evidence Hatch can handle the workload. He's a No. 4/5 starter with heightened risk of hitting his decline phase during his arb years.",,"sa738514"

He has a short, high-effort swing, and his hands load high and take a curt, direct path to the ball with plus bat speed that Hiraldo generates with effort and violence. It's a swing-happy, pull-heavy approach to contact that would ideally become more polished, but there's rare bat speed and vertical plate coverage here, so Hiraldo has a talent-based shot to both hit and hit for power. 
Hiraldo is stocky and strong in general, let alone for his age, and even though he's playing lots of shortstop right now, I think he'll end up as a shift-aided second or third baseman at physical maturity. He has physical ability to profile every day in that sort of role but the approach needs to develop.","lIpzLYf2EHg","sa3005486"

What scouts think of Van Eyk has depended on when they've seen him.

All of what he ends up doing with the bat depends on how his body develops. Right now, like most fresh-faced prospects about to embark on their first pro season, de Castro has room on the frame for 20 or 30 pounds.

There are definite starter components here, led by two breaking balls with different velocities (their shapes are relatively similar) and some nascent changeup feel. The changeup development will be of particular importance because of how it will pair with the sinking action on most of Kloffenstein's fastballs. Because he doesn't generate big-breaking spin, Kloffenstein's slider and curve will depend on his ability to locate them. He's looking like a backend sinker/slider guy.",,"sa3008578"

He was much older than the typical high school prospect (he and Adam Kloffenstein, who was drafted the year before, were born nine days apart), and that colors the fastball projection, but what is lost there might be gained through a better delivery. Williams had some cross-bodied mechanical violence as an amateur that might be ironed out in pro ball, and already may have been. He had a Mike Clevinger look in the bullpen this spring. 
Whether or not more velo comes, Williams is already a big, strong kid whose fastball has been up to 96, and he creates vertical depth on his breaking ball. There's sizable relief risk here because of the delivery, but No. 4 starter ceiling if that's corrected or overcome.",,"sa3011674"

He does have many electric, catalytic qualities, though. Brown is twitchy and has elite speed, and his swing is compact and has a chance to enable a contact-oriented leadoff skillset if Brown matures as a hitter.

During his .330/.406/.537 tear on the Cape, he started to strike out more often. That carried into his junior year at Duke in very concerning fashion, as his strikeout rate spiked from 16% the year before to a whopping 26%, a rate that most teams consider a red flag, putting hitters on the wrong side of binary hit tool evaluation. 
The strikeouts continued in Low-A but, boy, does Conine have mood-altering power. His exit velos and hard hit rate were on par with Yordan Alvarez's last year, though Conine is older than Alvarez and played several levels below him. This performance -- .283/.371/.576 with 22 homers, 19 doubles, and a 36% strikeout rate -- came in just 80 games because Conine was popped for PED's (ritalinic acid, a stimulant) and served a 50-game suspension to start 2019.

He mostly pitches to contact with a low-90s sinker that has very steep downhill plane thanks to his height and fairly upright delivery. It has helped him generate groundball rates near 60% as a pro. Both of his breaking balls survive because Zeuch locates them. He'll get ahead of hitters with his curveball and keep his slider just off the plate away from righties. He may be a candidate for a true splitter, or a modified version of it, rather than a straight changeup if the Jays want to try to turn him into Doug Fister, with whom Zeuch shares several other traits.

Based on this, Toronto pushed him to an affiliate quickly, and he pitched at Bluefield as a 17-year-old in 2018, his first pro summer. He dealt with injuries throughout 2019 and his stuff was very average, with the fastball resting in the 90-93 range. He had elbow soreness during the spring of 2019, pitched in Extended for a while, got to Lansing late, made seven starts, then was shut down in mid-August. His elbow barked at him again this spring and Pardinho had Tommy John in mid-February. 
What made Pardinho appealing as an amateur -- his polish and potential to move quickly -- is now gone after the two years impacted by injury, and it's been a while since his stuff was exciting.

Taylor was shut down and given a PRP injection to remedy a UCL strain without surgery and didn't pitch the second half of last year. Before he was shelved and traded, he was typically throwing 35 to 50 pitches once every three to five days, seemingly in preparation for some kind of multi-inning role.

Curiously, while he has several traits indicative of an effective fastball (its spin rate is above average, and it has backspin and plus-plus vertical movement), his heater only generated a 6% swinging strike rate last year. He's lost a tick on his heater each of the last two seasons and has gone from sitting 93-97 to sitting 91-96, but again this has been as a starter rather than in the short-outing, piggyback-style usage Perez enjoyed before Houston traded him to the Jays in the Roberto Osuna deal.
