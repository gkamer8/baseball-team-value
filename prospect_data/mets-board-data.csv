"Ronny Mauricio","NYM","SS","A",35,1,,"55",2023,,"19.2416666","6' 3""","166","S","R",2017,"J2","NYM",2100000,"Dominican Republic","Similar to the way Andres Gimenez skipped over short season ball (though, he also skipped over the GCL), the Mets pushed Mauricio to Low-A after he had spent just a year on the complex. He was three and a half years younger than the average Sally League player and was still hitting an impressive .283/.323/.381 before he had a lousy August. The exciting physical characteristics -- a lanky, projectable frame, the sort you typically see on the mound, the hands, actions, feet, and arm strength for short, precocious feel to hit -- shared by Mauricio's franchise-altering shortstop predecessors, the stuff that had us deliriously excited about him before he even signed, are still present. 
The explosiveness and physicality of cornerstone, power-hitting shortstops still percolates beneath the surface, which is fine because Mauricio will be 18 until April and it isn't reasonable to expect that he'd already have grown into impact power. When most players his age are either in the midst of their freshman season of college or getting ready to start Extended Spring Training, he might be in the Florida State League. Because he'll be so young and in a pitcher-friendly league, it's very likely that a year from now, we'll be ignoring a pretty lousy statline for contextual reasons. With another full year of data to consider, we now know Mauricio is a little swing-happy and that, even if that explosion arrives, he either needs to develop feel for lift or tweak the swing if all the power is to actualize. Hopefully we're not living in the timeline where Mauricio outgrows shortstop and those two things remain issues. Switch-hitting shortstops with power, uh, don't really exist. That Mauricio has a chance to be one means he may one day be the top overall prospect in baseball, and several outcomes short of that ideal are still very, very good.","NvOA8y_cZGI","sa3006887"

Defensively, at either short or second, Gimenez's wide array of skills, especially his range (it's less important than it used to be because of improved positioning, but Gimenez can really go get it) is going to make him a strong middle infield defender. 
On offense, even though Gimenez spent 2019 all the way up at Double-A Binghamton, things are less clear. He looked physically overmatched against Double-A pitching, which is fine because he was only 20, but he was also chasing a lot and seemed doomed if he fell behind in counts because of it. The all-fields spray (lots of oppo doubles) that comes when Gimenez targets more hittable pitches is very promising. We're not optimistic that any kind of impact power will ever come (he'll golf one out to his pull side once in a while), but the hit tool and doubles would be plenty to profile everyday on the middle infield if Gimenez learns to be more selective.","0daljrqAYUs","sa917114"

But he also put up an above-average statline in full-season ball as a teenager and he has some of the most exciting, frame-based power projection in all the minors. He's tied for the highest average exit velo among hitters on this list and he has room for another 20 pounds on the frame, which is likely to come since Vientos was one of the younger prospects in his draft class and is younger than 2019 first rounder, Brett Baty. Because we're talking about a corner bat with strikeout/walk rate yellow flags, Vientos is a high-risk bat but the power gives him middle-of-the-order potential.","ax1yE3rIWCs","sa3004720"

A player's age relative to his peers is a predictive variable for pro success (younger is better) and Baty is older than a lot of 2018's high school draftees, against whom we had pro performance to judge while Baty only had high school stats on draft day. 
Baty compares quite closely to Cardinals 2018 first rounder and top 100 prospect Nolan Gorman: he's big, strong, and has huge power and advanced feel to hit. He may not be an athletic fit at third base, especially long-term, and is at risk of moving to first, but his quicker-than-expected feet (he's a standout hoops player as well) could help delay that. Baty essentially held serve in his first taste of pro ball and his 2020 season will go a long way to dictating his value, as another half-season of pro performance will wipe out all the pre-draft considerations.","rXT1HH8Lgkw","sa3010869"

His fastball and breaking ball were both anywhere from 60 to 70 grade pitches during the spring depending on the day and scout, while his changeup was a 55 at times over the summer, when he also sometimes flashed average command. If you put together the best elements from both versions of Allan, there's a potential ace, but the worry is that either one or the other will the the actual outcome, which is still a solid mid-rotation type. 
He's not projectable and is an average athlete, so there are some limits on his upside. He had a rumored $4 million price tag in the draft, which many thought would push him to college, but he ended up changing his asking price and signing for $2.5 million in the third round after throwing a much higher number out to clubs that almost took him at multiple spots in the first. Mets brass are thrilled with their first draft under the new regime and some specifically think Allan is already the best prospect of the group. He could be a top 100 prospect by midseason if he continues his current streak of good health and performance, as his TrackMan figures are very strong.",,"sa3011740"

But Alvarez's first pro season was statistically impressive. He only played in 42 games, but he hit .312/.407/.510 (mostly in the Appy League) while playing very good defense and appearing more svelte and conditioned than he had as an amateur. 
His swing (his front foot is down very early) could stand to be a little more athletic to take advantage of his movement skills, but he rotates hard anyway and his hitting posture enables him to lift pitches in various locations. The receiving, lateral mobility, and arm strength are all promising on the defensive side, too. Teen catchers are risky and often take forever to develop, but Alvarez's track record of hitting extends back to amateur play, so we're a little more comfortable here. We view him very similarly to the way we viewed Miguel Amaya a few years ago, except Amaya's frame was more obviously projectable.","TG-p0lUDzpM","sa3010862"

His first year in Starkville, Ginn was up to 96, flashing the same plus slider he had in high school, but more imporanyl he walked just 19 hitters in 86 innings. He entered his draft-eligible sophomore year in the middle of a crowded group of first round college arms, but tore his UCL during his first start and needed Tommy John. He'll be back late in 2021 and projects as a no. 4 starter.","cqH8dHsLdMQ",

He had a rough pre-draft showcase summer, and while he rebounded later in 2019 with Team USA, he didn't have an extended opportunity to do so throughout a 2020 season. Crow-Armstrong did, however, come out having added substantial muscle and some teams think he'll hit for more power than the industry would have projected based solely on 2019 looks. The headline skill here, though, is PCA's defense in center field, which is the best in the draft class regardless of demographic.","OKVGzkQFc7A",

He worked in 20 to 30-pitch stints for the first several weeks of the year before rounding into more traditional starter form late. His sinker and changeup have similar movement, which will benefit the change (which is just fine in a vacuum). The curveball, though, the pitch that enabled Szapucki's earlier breakout, remains excellent. We're hoping more mechanical consistency in season two back from TJ will yield better command, but even if this iteration of Szapucki is where things settle, that'll still be a strong multi-inning relief piece if not a No. 4/5 starter.","aaIRseQiZNU","sa875054"

Then he had two decent years at Oregon before he dominated as a junior, striking out 140 hitters and walking just 15 in 100 innings. He has never had a plus pitch, nor does he project to have one, and instead works in the low-90s with tough angle and great extension, and several other pitches. He doesn't have high spin rates on his breaking stuff and pitches more to weak contact with a sinking, sometimes cutting changeup, looking like a steady, durable, No. 4/5 starter who we'll see in the big leagues this year.","CFTWy9cdytY","sa829588"

He has shown a starter's mix of pitches, especially during his brief time with the Mets (he was acquired from Philly for Asdrúbal Cabrera ahead of the 2018 deadline) when his strike throwing and changeup improved. Prior to that, he had been pretty raw for a pitcher his age and had begun to look like a bullpen arm, an outcome that became more likely due to the injury and his presence on New York's 40-man. There's a chance Kilome looks really good in the spring and the Mets decide to let him start while managing his workload, but we expect to see mid-90s heat and a great curveball out of the bullpen sometime in 2020.","BMD8EhJwlVg","sa830592"

This is an extreme risk hit tool prospect, the kind who sometimes tricks us into thinking relevant adjustments have been made and performs at upper levels only to flail at big league pitching (see: Brinson, Lewis), but also sometimes becomes Aaron Judge. 
Newton is built like an SEC wide receiver, he already has sizable power and will likely grow into more, while also staying on the left side of the infield. He has a shot to be what we have Mauricio projected to be; a switch-hitting shortstop or third baseman with impact power. But Newton has run two consecutive years of strikeout rates up around 32% and the quality of his at-bats is wildly variable. He's still growing into his body, so perhaps more reliable bat-to-ball skills will arrive once he does. Even if he cuts the K's down to the 25% range, we could be talking about a valuable everyday big leaguer.",,"sa917119"

Wolf's frame and delivery aren't ideal for a 200 inning type, but the stuff is loud, the arm is fresh, the velo is new, and there's no track record of any trouble in the way of injuries, overuse, or walk rate, so at some point we're just nitpicking.",,"sa3011638"

He's a big lefty who sits around 90 with a three-pitch mix, but he was used in a number of roles in college, so nobody was really pounding the table for him. Well, maybe they should have been: he carved up Low-A after being drafted, then did the same to High-A and before pitching well at Double-A as a 22-year-old in his first full season. The stuff still isn't great, but his slider flashes above average, his fastball has a solid spin rate and overall characteristics to go along with some deception and the feel to get the most out of his stuff.

We think there's a gap between the contact performance (Palmer hit .250) and actual skill at this point, but that's okay for such a lanky, cold-weather, out-of-nowhere high school prospect. 
The measureable power Palmer generates on contact is shocking. He's tied with Mark Vientos and Brett Baty for the highest average exit velo on this list and he's arguably more physically projectable than either of them. His long-term defensive profile is still unclear, and Palmer's ability to make contact and recognize offspeed stuff is raw.

And so, the scouting report remains the same as it did on last year's list: Hernandez runs well enough to stay in center field and he has sizable raw power for a teenager. The cement on the bod is pretty dry, and while we think that means limited power projection, it also probably means Hernandez stays in center.

He was then 94-97 at an event in the summer, and teams sat up straight to reconsider him, but some clubs wanted to see it another time or two to make sure it wasn't an anomaly. The Mets moved quickly, though Dominguez's bonus, which we were told was $95,000, reflected that level of uncertainty. 
Between when Dominguez was waiting for his contract to be approved and the end of Dominican instructs, he continued to sit in the mid-90s and hit 99, flashing a plus breaking ball at times. A scout who saw him during this period told us he would ""blow the doors off"" of the GCL this time next summer. He's only thrown a handful of times since the velo spike and not even all of the Mets upper level decision makers have seen him yet, but the talent level is on par with a compensation or second round pick.

Tylor has made notable improvements in pro ball to his breaking ball after going in the eighth round as a senior sign in 2018. One source described Tylor as a potential Robert Gsellman or Seth Lugo due to his high-octane stuff, spin rates, and multi-inning potential. Given his age, he could get to the big leagues in 2020 with continued refinement.",,"sa3007988"

He's an interesting developmental follow for now.",,"sa3008263"
