Young catchers are notoriously slow to develop as they adjust to the physical and mental demands of the position, which often stymies their offensive production. But Alvarez's first pro season was statistically impressive. He only played in 42 games, but he hit .312/.407/.510 (mostly in the Appy League) while playing very good defense and appearing more svelte and conditioned than he had as an amateur. 
His swing (his front foot is down very early) could stand to be a little more athletic to take advantage of his movement skills, but he rotates hard anyway and his hitting posture enables him to lift pitches in various locations. The receiving, lateral mobility, and arm strength are all promising on the defensive side, too. Teen catchers are risky and often take forever to develop, but Alvarez's track record of hitting extends back to amateur play. I was low on Alvarez last year, and he and Luis Campusano are in a talent tier of their own beneath Rutschman among catchers on the top 100. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>","TG-p0lUDzpM","sa3010862"

He's begun to pack noticeable mass onto the frame that had made him such an exciting amateur, the kind of prospect who could carry 30 more pounds and add power without losing the agility to play shortstop. Even though he's clearly gotten stronger (he's still listed at a comical 166; I felt I had to manually adjusted a bunch of listed weights in this system), Mauricio simply doesn't have the pure explosiveness of someone like Marco Luciano or Bobby Witt Jr., and while he might continue to get bigger and stronger, and add power that way, I don't think he'll end up having thunderous raw. There's still a pathway to stardom here; Mauricio is a switch-hitting shortstop with pretty good feel for contact after all. He'll need to refine either his swing or approach to be an everyday player, and probably both to be an impact one. Because he's so young, there's time for that to happen. Even if he <em>only</em> ends up with an average hit/power combination, that's a really valuable everyday shortstop. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>","NvOA8y_cZGI","sa3006887"

The Mets made a $2.5 million bet on him in the third round, one of several multi-million dollar bonuses they gave to high schoolers that year. It meant the Mets had to target signable seniors earlier than other teams, but that also meant they got the best ones. Allan signed, went to the GCL, and was 92-95 in his early work there. He cleaned up his frame (which I think gives him a better chance to repeat his delivery more consistently) and was parked well into the mid-90s at both the alt site and instructs. I've grown a little more skeptical of pitchers with rainbow breakers like Allan's, but if it turns out to be a problem, I think he has the feel for spin to quickly add a slider. His physical transformation is an indicator to me that he'll work to make that adjustment when asked. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em> ",,"sa3011740"

He's undergone a few minor swing changes since entering pro ball, and the latest iteration features a wider stance and toned-down leg kick, and is a close bedfellow to Spencer Torkelson's swing. 
Long-levered, corner-only prospects like Vientos are extremely risky, and the way his strikeout and walk rates trended in 2019 -- combined with the possibility that he might outgrow third base -- has led to some industry trepidation regarding his inclusion on the Top 100. But I like that he's been able to make swing adjustments, and Vientos also put up an above-average statline in full-season ball as a teenager and has some of the most exciting, frame-based power projection in all the minors. He torched balls in 2019, averaging just over 91 mph off the bat and putting 47% of them in play at 95 mph or above, which, for context, is a 65 on the scale. And he still has room for another 20 pounds on the frame. Proprietary metrics sourced for this list indicate that even though he only slugged .411 in 2019, his expected SLG based on the quality of his contact was closer to .480. I've seen Vientos get on top of elevated fastballs and drive stuff the other way with authority in a way that's uncommon for a hitter with levers this long. He's quite risky, but is also a potential middle-of-the-order anchor. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>","ax1yE3rIWCs","sa3004720"

Because of his age and size, which portends an eventual move to first base in the eyes of many scouts on both the amateur and pro side, this is the type of prospect for whom statistical performance is rather important. In this case, we have very little of that. Baty showed advanced feel to hit as a prepster, then struck out a ton against age-appropriate Appy League pitching in 2019. He spent 2020 at the alternate site and instructs, then got some run during 2021 spring training. 
Not only has Baty kept his body in check but it's actually better now than it was in high school. It gives him a better chance of staying at third base for a while but he's just so huge that I still think he'll ultimately end up playing first base. Video analysis of Baty at the alt site and in 2021 spring training, as well as a scout source's in-person look during the fall, indicate this is a guy with limited barrel precision, and that most of his offensive output is going to come from his advanced feel for the strike zone and light tower power. It's hard to say someone is tracking like a three true outcomes type of hitter when there's almost no statistical evidence to support that, but that's indeed what the visual reports on Baty suggest we're about to see. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>","rXT1HH8Lgkw","sa3010869"

He had a rough pre-draft showcase summer, and while he rebounded later in 2019 with Team USA, he didn't have an extended opportunity to do so in 2020 because of the pandemic. Crow-Armstrong did, however, come out having added substantial muscle and some teams think he'll hit for more power than the industry would have projected based solely on 2019 looks. 
The headline skill here, though, is PCA's defense in center field, which was the best in the draft class regardless of demographic. It's fun just watching him shag balls during BP. Like Blake Rutherford before him, Crow-Armstrong has a pretty swing geared for low-ball contact. He's especially adept at lifting breaking balls in the air but may struggle against velocity at the letters. His potential Gold Glove-caliber center field defense makes him a likely big leaguer, but issues with top-of-zone velocity may prevent him from being a complete offensive player. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>","OKVGzkQFc7A","sa3014458"

He entered his draft-eligible sophomore year (2020) in the middle of a crowded group of first-round college arms, but tore his UCL during his first start and needed Tommy John.

He had four years of statistical success while with Kansas City but his in-game power output has come down as he's climbed. During Lee's 2019 season at Double-A, he hit .264/.363/.372 with a 12% walk rate and a whopping 53 steals. Then Lee spent 2020 at the Royals' alternate site and went to play winter ball in Puerto Rico for the second consecutive offseason. He didn't hit well there but did look pretty good in center field. In February, Lee was part of the Andrew Benintendi three-team deal and ended up with the Mets. 
He wasn't as good during his few defensive opportunities this spring and, as he always has, Lee continues to strike out a lot. He is a power-over-hit type of prospect who takes giant hacks, often falling to one knee as he finishes. His big, long, uppercut swing and huge bat speed generate considerable raw power but also lead to lots of strikeouts, and he can really only lift pitches in the bottom of the strike zone. He has the tools of a three true outcomes right fielder, one who potentially plays above-average corner outfield defense. Maybe some of this is due to how intense his swings are, but I get 40-grade run times on Lee from home to first, and I don't see him stealing a ton of bases or playing center field in the big leagues. The quality of his at-bats against elite competition has been mixed, at best. It's likely going to take a swing adjustment to get Lee hitting for relevant power in games. I think he could be the larger half of a corner platoon if either more of that pop shows up in games or Lee's approach eventually enables him to make more contact. <em>(Alternate site, Puerto Rican Winter League)</em>","55IWf1Fbris","19952"

Scouts' looks at the Mets' fall camp were variable because the last two weeks of the team's camp were cancelled due to positive COVID tests in the group and also played a lot of intrasquads. In Ramirez's case, he was seen a lot taking swings off high speed pitching machines. The combination of body projection, bat speed/rotation, and present pull-side power here is really exciting. This is a young man who might grow into huge raw power. He's a little narrow in the waist but has the room to add at least 30 pounds as he enters his mid-20s. With that could come 30-plus homer power.

In his sole 2021 spring training inning, he sat 92-94, which is in line with his early-game velocities from 2019. We're talking about a 24-year-old who has never thrown more than 62 innings in a season and has had several bouts with injury, so it's increasingly likely Szapucki ends up pitching in relief. 
But we're also talking about a lefty with a plus curveball who has struck out more than a batter per inning when healthy, so there's still potential impact here. Even at its typical velocities, which are just below the big league average, Szapucki's fastball has garnered above-average rates of swing-and-miss in the minors (a 13% swinging strike rate on his fastball based on the 2019 minor league data I sourced) thanks in part to its flat angle. If he can continue to live in the 92-94 range like he has this spring, then Szapucki will end up with at least two above-average pitches and be a fine relief fit. If his changeup can actually develop, which still feels possible considering how many reps he has missed, then perhaps he can work in a multi-inning role or one of more significant leverage. That Szapucki is on the 40-man and yet was given just one in-game look before being optioned is perhaps not a great sign here, but it still feels like there's a middle relief floor with a chance for more impact than that at peak. <em>(Alternate site)</em>","aaIRseQiZNU","sa875054"

Newton remains an extreme-risk hit tool prospect and a scout who has seen a bunch of him the last couple of years told me they don't think any progress was evident at 2020 instructs. He had run two consecutive years of strikeout rates up around 32% and the quality of his at-bats is wildly variable. He's still growing into his body, so perhaps more reliable bat-to-ball skills will arrive once he does.

The measurable power Palmer generates on contact is shocking. He's tied with Mark Vientos and Brett Baty for the highest average exit velo on this list and he's arguably more physically projectable than either of them. His long-term defensive profile is still unclear: the Mets played him all over the field during 2020 instructs and will continue to do so in 2021. Palmer's ability to make contact and recognize offspeed stuff is raw, and like Newton there's a chance that he never makes enough contact to be a viable big leaguer.

Gilliam could've received a low-to-mid six figure bonus out of high school but instead went to Clemson, where he mostly relieved, a role that agreed with his aggressive approach and fastball/curveball combination. Gilliam traversed three levels and reached Triple-A in his first full season (2019) but had rashes of wildness, especially toward the end of the year. According to a non-Mets source, he exhibited a bump to both his fastball and curveball spin at the 2020 alt site (up from 2400 and 2600 rpm to 2600 and 2700), and during 2021 spring training experimented with a slider that wasn't there before.

His changeup has indeed gotten better since he was acquired by the Mets (though his curveball spin rate in 2020 is below what I sourced from 2018, when it was about 2400 rpm) and he has three real weapons with which to attack hitters, and as many as five if you count his four- and two-seamers as different pitches.

He wasn't part of New York's 2020 instructs contingent, so we have basically no new information from the last two years. Healthy Hernandez ran well enough to stay in center field and had sizeable raw power for a teenager. The cement on the bod is pretty dry, and while I think that means limited power projection, it also probably means Hernandez's chances to stay in center field may be a little more stable, assuming he has his pre-injury speed when he returns. While his 2018 slash line was strong (yeesh it feels scary to write that -- it's been a long time since this guy has played), there were some underlying swing-and-miss issues that might rear their ugly head in a more meaningful way in 2021. <em>(At-home dev)</em>",,"sa3005487"

He's got solid feel to hit and works counts, but has more of a role player look due to mediocre raw power and bat speed. Toffey proponents will note he's made offensive adjustments at each level and improved the more he's played there; detractors would argue he's been old for those minor league levels. He's a solid defender with a plus arm who probably fits best as a lefty platoon corner bat. He was neither at the alt site nor instructs and was passed over in the Rule 5, so I'd feel more comfortable leaving Toffey here if he goes out and hits immediately in 2021. <em>(At-home dev)</em>","XL3eRFTCj3k","sa829401"

He has a giant, broad-shouldered frame, though he's a well below-average on-mound athlete. But when he's been healthy, Otanez has missed bats and avoided walks two out of his three pro seasons. He missed a year because of TJ and then 2020 because of the pandemic. The Mets did not invite him to instructs. If he can find a bat-missing secondary, he could end up as a viable reliever.

He posted three consecutive above-average offensive seasons to begin his career and then his performance tanked in 2018, when Lindsay was coming back from nerve transposition surgery and again dealt with several injuries. He went to the Fall League that year and definitely looked like a big swing-and-miss risk, but he also got to a ton of his power in games. Lindsay only played for a couple of weeks the following year before he again got hurt, and then we had no 2020 season to check in with him again. Maybe there's someone-look bias here but I like the approach/power combination Lindsay brings to the table. He needs to come out of the gate and hit to stay on here and it's not a great sign that the Mets didn't include him in their fall group. <em>(At-home dev)</em>","akUuQZG6dnk","sa874792"
