Well, it did. I saw Jung a few times in college and again after he was drafted, and while he struck balls with authority, he was inside-outing everything to center or right-center field and couldn't really get around the baseball to pull it, even during batting practice. While Jung's strength and feel to hit enabled a high quality of contact despite this atypical style, there are just times when it's best for hitters to turn on middle-in mistakes and park them in the left field seats or rip them down the line for a double, and I finally saw Jung start to do that in the fall of 2020. He was a .346/.452/.562 career hitter at Tech and had more walks than strikeouts during his last two years with the Red Raiders. Originally thought to be a risk to move to first base, Jung has not only allayed those concerns but also played a passable college shortstop and deserves an extended look at second base in pro ball to see if he can do it. He's 23 and still hasn't played above A-ball because of the pandemic, and his 2021 season got off to a delayed start because of a stress fracture in his left foot. But Jung has a long enough offensive track record to feel confident that he'll hit enough to profile at third base, and if he can pass at second, then he'll rocket up this list toward the top of the 50 FV tier at least.","RlBShzGPoCY","sa3011468"

As a college prospect, he looked more like a contact-oriented second baseman who draft models liked because he performed on paper against SEC pitching and was barely 21 on draft day. Now he looks like a tank, and I saw him hit several tape measure bombs during the spring. His size does limit some of his defensive mobility but it doesn't completely impede him, and I think Foscue will be a viable second baseman, just probably not a very good one. He's tracking like a righty-hitting version of Dodgers Top 100 prospect Michael Busch, and he'll similarly move onto the 100 if his surprising new physicality manifests as in-game power production this year.",,"sa3014527"

He didn't pitch the summer after he was drafted as a workload precaution, threw a little in the fall, then was uncharacteristically wild the following year, walking 39 hitters in 69 innings. Feel for his release point had evaporated and Winn spiked an awful lot of non-competitive secondary pitches in the dirt. His stuff is still good, and his repertoire is still quite robust and visually pleasing, but Winn's stock was down due to this unexpected speed bump. He looked fantastic again this spring, sitting 94-95 while spotting four quality pitches of varying shape to their most effective locations. He can create tailing, bat-missing action on his changeup, his curveball has plus depth and bite, and his slider has enough movement to miss bats when it's spotted. If he can hold the velocity I saw this spring into the middle of the season, then we're talking about a Top 100 prospect.","JTWvLDwruWs","sa3008662"

He also dealt with a thumb injury late during his college career that shelved him for some of his first pro summer. By the late summer and during instructs, Wendzel was not only fully healthy but clearly in peak physical condition, and he and his tawny Amish beard and mullet were instrumental in the Rangers AZL title run. Wendzel's hands and actions might enable him to a play a passable shift-aided middle infield spot if he remains as agile as he looked late last year, which again is much different than just a few years ago when he was built more softly and playing some first base and left field. So far in 2021, he's played shortstop and third base. There are some Justin Turner similarities aside from the hair and beard, as Wendzel's swing is a carbon copy of Turner's. It enables him to get the barrel on inside pitches pretty consistently. This is a well-rounded player with a shot to play every day on the left side of the infield.",,"sa3011890"

He’s a muscular, 5-foot-11 stick of dynamite with plus raw power that I had previously doubted he would get to in games (from a home run production standpoint, anyway) because of how the swing works. He could turn on balls in, but anything away from the short-levered Walker really limited his quality of contact. Now his swing is different -- he's opened up his stance. I saw him hit an oppo bomb on a pitch out away from him this spring and a couple of scouts who I really trust loved their extended look at him early this year. Walker's cut has big lift through the zone even though it's a pretty compact swing. He hits the ball hard (43% of his balls in play in 2019 were hit over 95 mph according to a source) and I like his chances of making a viable amount of contact more now than I did with the old swing. There's 30-homer power here and a chance Walker blows up now that he has the opportunity to play at an age-appropriate level.",,"sa3008306"
"Dane Dunning","TEX","SP","MLB",,6,,"45",2020,"Low","26.4583333","6' 4""","225","R","R",2016,"Draft","WAS",2000000,"Florida","Dunning was an intriguing projection arm in high school who flashed average stuff and had a good blend of size and athleticism. He took a big step forward during his freshman year at Florida, though the rest of the talent on that pitching staff pushed him to a bullpen/midweek/spot starting role for much of his career. The industry still valued him in the first round by the time he was a junior, and Washington selected him 29th overall in 2016, before trading him that winter for eventual title contributor Adam Eaton. 
Dunning had a very strong 2017, when his prospect value hit its pinnacle; he was viewed as a near-ready No. 4 starter and a core part of Chicago's rebuild. Then he missed the second half of 2018 with an elbow strain and tore his UCL during 2019 spring training, which required surgery. The pandemic complicated his rehab and Dunning threw side sessions during the shutdown. He quickly became a reliable rotation piece and made a handful of starts for the playoff-bound White Sox before they included him as part of the return package for Lance Lynn. 
Dunning's velocity is down a tick in 2021 with the Rangers but he's able to command his low-90s sinker at the bottom of the zone.  He most often supports that with a low-80s, two-planed slider, a pitch aided by some of the funk in Dunning's delivery. He's a kitchen sink righty with command of a sinker, slider, changeup, cutter, and a rare curveball. His command needs to be plus for Dunning to be effective since his raw stuff is shy of big league average, but it has been for a long time now. He's a slam dunk No. 4/5 starter.",,"19409"
"Jonah Heim","TEX","C","MLB",,7,,"45",2020,"Low","25.9388888","6' 4""","220","S","R",2013,"Draft","BAL",389700,"Amherst HS (NY)","Catching inventory is limited around baseball, and Heim has several underlying characteristics that might indicate he’s going to break late and become a viable everyday backstop. He has hopped around a bit: a 2013 fourth-round high school draftee from the Buffalo area, he was eventually traded from Baltimore to Tampa Bay for Steve Pearce, then to Oakland as the PTBNL for Joey Wendle, then to Texas as the main return for Elvis Andrus. 
From 2017 to ’19, Heim posted batting lines above the minor league average of the level at which he was playing. This is a 6-foot-4, switch-hitting catcher from a cold-weather climate, and those traits are generally considered markers for late-career development, though that is anecdotal. He's currently splitting time with Jose Trevino, but I think Heim will eventually be a clear upgrade to Trevino on offense, and a more consistent offensive performer than Sam Huff. David García, the other catcher on Texas’ 40-man, is only 21 and still too green to factor into the big league picture at all right now. Heim receives from a traditional squat, with his glove hand working from the ground up. He's a great framer and will show you average pop times on trials when he's catching the ball to his glove side, and below average times when he has to reach across his body. He's a long-term defensive fit back there and has more offensive skill than is typical at the position.",,"16930"
"Yerry Rodriguez","TEX","SP","AA",,8,,"45",2021,"Med","23.6388888","6' 2""","198","R","R",2015,"J2","TEX",60000,"Dominican Republic","Rodriguez was a 50 FV prospect last year despite missing the back half of 2019 with an elbow injury, the latest in a long line of Rangers pitching prospects to have one. Rodriguez amassed 167 K and 29 BB over the 136.2 innings he had thrown in two seasons leading up to that point, and did so by relying heavily on his ability to locate a quality fastball and changeup. In the fall of 2020, back on a mound and competing in a live setting for the first time in over a year, Rodriguez was once again up to 98, and sat anywhere from 92-98 during his instructs/intrasquad outings. That was enough for Texas to add him to their 40-man roster during the offseason. 
His arm action is still quite long even though Rodriguez is a short-armed guy, and his arm slot presents an almost sidearm look but without the same cross-bodied delivery typical of side-armers. Its approach angle and spin (both axis and rate) give it an odd combination of ride and tail that makes it pretty tough to hit, and it's weaponized by Rodriguez's east/west command. When Yerry was really carving up hitters in the low minors, before he first had a long injury layoff, his changeup had more arm-side movement and bat-missing tumble than when I saw him during the spring of 2021. Yerry's arm angle makes it really hard for him to get on top of his breaking ball and I don't love its angle, but it does move enough to miss bats and his glove-side command of it is quite good. It needs to be, because this type of breaking ball is the kind that gets crushed when it's left in the middle of the zone. 
I'd really like to see a second breaking ball here, or at least a means of creating better back foot angle against lefties, though it's a little harder to envision for a guy of this arm slot. He needs something he can work inside on lefties, either a cutter or a more traditional breaking ball with better back foot angle. Maybe that can be found by altering Rodriguez's spot on the rubber depending on the matchup. I've cooled on him a bit but think Yerry is a likely backend rotation piece or could thrive in a Ryan Yarbrough style bulk relief role.","8-2tF4ZEJGw","sa918130"

It's the recent injury history paired with the industry's mechanical xenophobia that fuels the relief projection here, not Crouse's command or repertoire depth. His changeup now comfortably projects to average, while his fastball/breaking ball combination has been excellent since he was a high school underclassman. And even amid his injuries, Crouse has attacked hitters in games. On occasion, he incorporates all kinds of crafty veteran wrinkles into his delivery's cadence. An extra shoulder wiggle, a Travoltaian gyration of the hips, the occasional quick-pitch -- all sorts of things designed to take hitters by surprise. Lefties get a good look at his fastball because of Crouse's low slot, and the velo he would theoretically gain out of the bullpen (he was up to 102 out of the bullpen in a 2017 All-Star Game) would give him the margin for error he needs to not be crushed by them. I think he's a late-inning bullpen arm, for which his personality seems well-suited.","Gf8YWJV_O58","sa3004642"

He's also become a solid defender despite his size. At 6-foot-5, 240 pounds, Huff is the biggest catcher in baseball. He receives on one knee with the bases empty but moves to a traditional crouch with two strikes and with runners on. His lateral quickness and footwork on throws to second weren't really tested during his 2020 debut, but Huff is good at blocking balls right in front of him and has enough raw arm strength to catch. While a pair of early-2021 lower half injuries (first a hamstring strain, then knee surgery to ""remove loose bodies"") may give one pause when viewed in concert with his size, Huff feels like a pretty sure bet to stay at the position. Instead, questions now surround his ability to make contact. Huff has K'd at a 30% career rate. He's a long-levered free swinger, and struggles to lay off well-placed sliders. The bar for offense at catcher is so low that I think Huff will be able to approach or clear it solely by doing huge damage on the mistakes he sees, but his statistical track record is an awful lot like Jorge Alfaro's, an indication that Huff's ability to do that will vacillate wildly. I expect he'll eventually be in a timeshare with Heim that includes starts at 1B/DH and pinch hit opportunities.",,"22209"
"Leody Taveras","TEX","CF","AAA",,11,,"45",2021,"Med","22.7416666","6' 1""","195","S","R",2015,"J2","TEX",2100000,"Dominican Republic","I foolishly ascribed meaning to Taveras' 2020 statline and moved him into the back of the 50 FV tier ahead of the Top 100's publication. Then he flopped really hard to start 2021. His speed and center field defense are both excellent, which creates a floor of sorts, but scout opinions regarding how much Taveras will hit have varied. Though young for every level he's been at, Taveras hasn't performed on paper since his AZL campaign. Most pointed to this as sufficient evidence of his mediocrity, while others thought he looked bored and would flip a switch in the big leagues. I think Leody has above-average feel for contact as a left-handed hitter and that his right-handed swing is almost unusable, but his decent-looking 2020 splits reflect the opposite of that, a signal that it was a small sample mirage, a signal I ignored during the offseason. He has some table-setting qualities and has produced at about a 95 wRC+ clip throughout his pro career, which is on par with Harrison Bader and Jackie Bradley Jr., who have a power-over-hit version of this sort of defense-driven profile. And so I have a fourth outfielder grade on Taveras.","sxJR4Ast1fo","18900"

I saw his first game; he looked a little more trim but otherwise his usual self: Acosta had an impressive instructs run from a bat-to-ball standpoint and generated stronger reports among pro scouts who saw him there than the lukewarm ones amateur scouts filed from their workout looks. Acosta's tools aren't showcase-friendly. He has uncommon barrel control and his swing is not only suited for him to make contact at the top of the strike zone, it's also where he does most of his damage. He's vulnerable down and away, where he ends up cutting at balls on a decline and driving them into the ground, but lower-level pitching won't be able to exploit that consistently. For someone still shy of 19, Acosta is pretty stocky and strong. If his build stays this way, it improves his chances of staying on the middle infield but also caps his raw power close to average. Regardless of which marginal side of average his power ends up settling on, the contact is what's going to drive Acosta's prospectdom, and based on fall looks, that aspect could be special.","Ewa6drN9XGs","sa3014711"

At a time when everyone has a camera in their pocket and the internet exists, it's almost impossible for an early-round prospect to be hidden in a true sense. The 2020 shutdown contributed to Carter's obfuscation (and might again for some 2021 prospects). Many other teams knew of Carter, but did not know his prospectdom in a thorough sense; some thought he was unsignable, others were entirely unaware of him as I was. The Rangers took him 50th overall and he signed for $1.25 million. 
His 2020 instructs and '21 minor league spring look were both impressive, especially from a breaking ball recognition standpoint. For a hitter who barely saw premium high school pitching as an amateur, his ability to pick out pro-quality breaking balls and lay off of them is remarkable. Pitch recognition and bat control are Carter's two carrying traits right now. He makes great swing decisions and rarely whiffs when he decides to swing. But his bat path, explosiveness, and power are all current issues driving down his quality of contact. Carter has a sweepy bat path that generates a lot of softer groundball contact. He's most able to do damage when he turns his wrists over to catch fastballs toward the north end of the strike zone, but more often he's peppering the infield grass. 
Will relevant power come? I'm skeptical. Carter has a rectangular 6-foot-4 frame with a fair bit of surface-level projection if you just look at his measurables, but he's built really narrowly, closer to Triston McKenzie from a body comp standpoint than to the other high-profile prep outfielders from the 2020 draft. However, this was once also true of Cody Bellinger, though Carter doesn't have the twitch and explosion of baby Bellinger, who looked like a newborn giraffe at Area Codes. The avenues to power involve more significant physical growth than I expect and/or an impactful swing re-work. I don't think it's especially likely that both of those occur, so I don't think it's likely Carter is some sort of future superstar. Instead he looks like a table-setting center fielder. He's a plus runner underway and has good defensive instincts, while his approach, ability to put balls in play, and speed are all catalytic qualities that fit at the top of a lineup.",,"sa3014490"

He was handled with kid gloves the summer after he was drafted, blew out the next year, had 2020 wiped away by the pandemic, then made a start and broke his hand. The good news is that it isn't a scary arm injury and instead was a freak thing. White has looked fantastic when healthy, sitting 93-95, locating a consistently above-average curveball, and displaying nascent feel for a mid-80s changeup during my 2018 instructs look and again during 2021 spring training. He has a big, projectable frame, is an above-average on-mound athlete, and his arm action is loose and mechanically efficient. While the shutdown impacted Texas' oversight of his rehab, White's big league timeline was less affected by the shutdown than most minor leaguers' since he was always going to spend most of the year rehabbing. When healthy, he had several significant components already in place (velocity, fastball movement, breaking ball quality) and White's other traits (changeup proclivity, athleticism, and feel for location) indicate he's poised to grow and develop into a well-rounded arm. He's a mid-rotation pitching prospect despite the lack of on-paper track record and I felt comfortable moving White back into the 45s after seeing where his velo was this spring. The way his workload limits coming off of so much missed time interact with his 40-man timeline and early-career role arguably makes this too aggressive. ","ECsEAbzzCsw","sa3014481"

That slider has solidified as a plus offering if not better, and is so gross that John Waters wants to make a movie about it. Like many other arms in this system, Slaten has a violent delivery that creates injury concern and relief risk, but he could work in high leverage situations if he ends up there since he'd likely enjoy a velo spike in shorter outings.

Despite measuring maybe -- <em>maybe</em> -- 5-foot-10 (maybe), his arm generates mid-90s velocity with grace and ease, and he goes right after hitters at the letters. He was 94-96 for me this spring. His upper-80s split/change has sinking, fading action and is aided by Henriquez's consistent arm speed. He'll double and triple up on the changeup. While his low-80s slurve is not of the same quality from a pure stuff standpoint, it plays fine when it's located and I think a plus on-mound athlete like Henriquez projects for at least above-average command. I don't think his size is a barrier to starting. He's a fantastic athlete, his delivery is well-balanced and controlled, and one of the variables in the formula for torque (essentially, stress on the elbow) is lever length, which causes me to question conventional wisdom that bigger pitchers are more durable. If Henriquez's breaking ball quality and/or consistency improves, then he's a candidate to move into the top 100.

He quickly adjusted to pro pitching and had a great first summer with Oakland, then was traded to Texas as part of the return for Mike Minor. His lower half is very stiff and upright throughout his swing, and he struggles to get underneath some pitches because of it. He's also had a litany of hamstring issues since signing. But Smith's hands were working differently during 2021 spring training and he was better able to turn on inside pitches and pull the ball with authority than the last time I saw him.

He often has clumsy in-the-box footwork but deft hitting hands. Last fall, he took several ugly-looking, unbalanced swings but still found a way to get the barrel there, and even when he miss-hits balls they're still put in play hard because of how strong Lora is.

Even though he hit more than 50 home runs combined in 2018 and '19, and slugged about .560 during that span, García's peripherals were so horrendous that he still managed to post batting lines below league average because he was only reaching base at a .290 clip, and everyone in the PCL was hitting for big power at that time. During that stretch, he was passed on the org depth chart by several players, including Tyler O'Neill, Arozarena, Oscar Mercado, and Lane Thomas, and fell into the ""toolsy older lottery ticket"" prospect bucket. The Cardinals eventually ran out of space and time and unceremoniously DFA'd Garcia, then traded him to Texas for cash. He spent 2020 at the alt site and got a three-game shot of espresso, then was foisted into the 2021 lineup and has been on a most epic heater. 
He already has 16 homers (he hit his 16th literally as I was typing this sentence on Wednesday), tied for the major league lead, and has come through in huge late-game moments. I do not expect it to continue because García's approach is still terrifying. He's near the bottom of the league in O-swing%, and he's in the bottom 25 of qualified hitters by Contact and Swinging Strike%. He's been beaten by velocity at the top of the zone and I think it's only a matter of time before opposing pitchers adjust to him, though García's 16th bomb was a 94 mph heater at the letters so maybe he's the one who's going to adjust. I don't want to throw water on the situation because García is a lot of fun and part of me wants to be vindicated for stuffing this guy on the top 100 a couple of years ago, but we see shooting star performances like this every so often and García has several of the approach-related traits that indicate it will end and that he'll be a streaky bench outfielder deep into his 30s.",,"19287"

Ozuna has a middle relief look.",,"sa739259"

It’s likely he'll continue to throw harder as he matures based on his frame and athleticism.

He got off to a hot start at Double-A in 2021, but the visual evaluation of his bat-to-ball skills is still poor. He can really fly, he has power, and is a tough, hard-working kid who plays like he loves baseball, the sort of player who I'd like to succeed but fear will not because of the bat.","KipPA56WeHo","sa3004140"

Gonzalez's swing-and-miss issues stem from his lever length, and the industry sees it as enough of a problem that it has passed him over during the last couple of Rule 5 drafts. He hit 23 homers and stole 14 bases at Low-A in 2019, and I'm still betting on his tools and frame to some degree, the same as Seise and Thompson except in an outfield corner rather than up the middle.","0ZYOxS1M2BA","sa872568"

As I mentioned, we're not talking about a Chris Gittens type of thumper here, as Terry's physical tools are more modest than that.
