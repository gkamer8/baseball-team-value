Rodriguez checks all but two significant boxes. One is the ""totally healthy"" box, as he was shut down with an elbow issue in July. The other is the thoroughly modern ""vertical slot/backspin"" box typical of starters whose fastballs I'm more confident in. But this is not a vanilla, three-quarters slot. Rodriguez is well below that, and his upright, short-armed, slingy arm action presents almost a side arm look. It's unique, and creates an awful lot of tail on his fastball. Sitting 92-95, up to 98, and weaponized by Rodriguez's advanced east/west command, it's a potential plus pitch. A split-action changeup is currently his best secondary, while his slow curveball lacks sharp-looking movement but has plus raw spin. 
I think a fully-formed Rodriguez has a different breaking ball than this one, so in this instance I'm making an abstract projection based on Yerry's talent for spinning the baseball. He needs something he can work inside on lefties, either a cutter or a more traditional breaking ball with better back foot angle. From a performance standpoint, Rodriguez has 167 K and 29 BB over the 136.2 innings he's thrown the last two years. He has the best combination of stuff and pitchability in the system.","8-2tF4ZEJGw","sa918130"

Solak is a high-effort player but effort alone won't solve his defensive issues, which have been apparent wherever he's played. That's mostly been second base with some left and center field, the last of which Texas revisited this spring. He can really hit, though, and the lowest single-season batting average he has posted since his freshman season at Louisville is .282. He'll likely hit for pretty average power, but if Texas can hide him day-to-day wherever opponents are least likely to put balls in play, he'll essentially be a multi-positional player with a plus stick.",,"19294"

The on-paper stats, underlying TrackMan data, and my visual evaluation of Hernandez all indicate that this might be a very special hitter whose hit and power combination will clear the high offensive bar at those positions. His little T-Rex arms enable Heriberto to be short to the baseball, but he's so strong and rotates with such ferocity that he still hits for power. I've seen him make mid-at-bat adjustments to quality offspeed stuff, swinging over a particularly good splitter only to recognize the next one, located in the same spot, and rope it into the corner for a double. He covers the whole plate (something that's gotten better since my first looks in 2018) but is tough to beat on the inner half, and after watching him rake all last summer and fall, I'm all in on him despite not generally favoring corner guys several levels beneath the big leagues.","ADS4KB2jOhc","sa3005630"

He inside-outs an awful lot of pitches and doesn't even really get around the ball during batting practice, though his strength and feel to hit enables a high quality of contact despite this atypical style. He was a .346/.452/.562 career hitter at Tech and had more walks than strikeouts during his last two years with the Red Raiders. Originally thought to be a risk to move to first base, Jung not only allayed those concerns but also played a passable college shortstop last season. He comfortably projects to third base in pro ball and is a potential everyday player, but I need to see him pull pitches with power before I 50 FV him.","RlBShzGPoCY","sa3011468"

He is rangy and athletic, and has good defensive footwork and plenty of arm for the infield's left side. His hands are not as consistent and some scouts have wanted to see him tried in center field, which he has the speed to play, though Texas has largely kept him at short and he's now one of two and a half shortstops (I'm counting Isiah Kiner-Falefa as a half) on the Rangers 40-man.
Tejeda has plus-plus bat speed and his hands work in a tight, lift-friendly circle, but he's so explosive that at times he's out of control (this is where the strikeouts come from). He managed to get to the power at Hi-A in 2018, when he homered 19 times, and if he can stay at shortstop and continue to mash like that in games, he'll be a good everyday player. He's in the same FV tier as high-variance shortstops with power, such as Greg Jones and Bryson Stott.","TdHxjNuX4iQ","sa872474"

He responded by posting a contact- and walk-driven 117 wRC+ in the first half, earning a promotion to Double-A Frisco for the second, where he proceeded to produce an unremarkable line that (here's a familiar phrase) is reasonable to forgive considering his age. 2019 was Taveras' best BABIP season in some time, notable because during the last few years scouts had sometimes described him as aloof or bored. His speed and center field defense are both excellent, which creates a floor of sorts, but scout opinions regarding how much Taveras will hit have varied and, more and more, are diverging from stat-based analysis when they're favorable. I think Leody has above-average feel for contact as a left-handed hitter and that his right-handed swing is almost unusable. I also think the power display he put on at the 2018 Futures Game was a caricature created by the event's baseballs, an opinion his TrackMan data supports. He's a glove-first, second division regular based on how he's tracking, but there's a subset of the industry who still thinks the bat is coming and hasn't shown up in the statline yet because of Leody's age.","sxJR4Ast1fo","sa912520"

He didn't pitch the summer after he was drafted as a workload precaution, threw a little in the fall, then was uncharacteristically wild the following year, walking 39 hitters in 69 innings. Feel for his release point had evaporated and Winn spiked an awful lot of non-competitive secondary pitches in the dirt. His stuff is still good, and his repertoire is still quite robust and visually good-looking, but Winn's stock is down due to this unexpected speed bump.","JTWvLDwruWs","sa3008662"

It makes logical sense, he hit .297/.380/.482 in college, most of that agains SEC competition, and at just 21.3 years old on draft day he's on the younger end of the college spectrum. Foscue's plate coverage, from the top of the zone to the bottom, is exceptional. He has vanilla physical tools but projects as a plus hitter, which even with 40 game power probably profiles at second base. There's a college bat vacuum in the middle of the first round and up-the-middle performers like Foscue are likely to fill it.",,

He utilizes a power-pitcher's approach, working at the letters with his fastball while mixing in lots of overhand curveballs, both of which are quite effective. Palumbo's changeup also has nasty-looking sink and tail but he doesn't really locate his fastball anywhere other than the top of the zone, which I think he'd have to be able to do to set up the change, so that pitch plays closer to average right now. Palumbo lacks traditional starter command and pitch utility, but he could work in a Lance McCullers sort of role or, because of repertoire depth, in effective, multi-inning relief.","qbSinLemqCA","17035"

I had been hopeful that, despite his size, Apostel would be able to stay at third base for a good chunk of his big league career, but while I still think his arm will help him stay there for a little while, he'll move to first base by his mid-20s, though there's still enough going on offensively that I have him projected as a second division regular there. His feel for the strike zone and his timing are both impressive for his age, and he is adept at attacking early-count pitches he can drive, while taking tough strikes. It helps him run deep counts (part of where the strikeouts come from), and walk as well as hit for power. He's performed on paper since first appearing on FanGraphs prospect lists in 2017 and at this point he's a low-variance corner role player who should put up 2 WAR seasons for as long as he can play third base.","43b_eXfFXFA","sa917364"

It's the recent injury history paired with the industry's mechanical xenophobia that fuels the relief projection here, not Crouse's command or repertoire depth. His changeup now comfortably projects to average, while his fastball/breaking ball combination has been excellent since he was a high school underclassman. And even amid his injuries Crouse has attacked hitters in games. He incorporates all kinds of crafty veteran wrinkles into his delivery's cadence on occasion. An extra shoulder wiggle, a Travoltaian gyration of the hips, the occasional quick-pitch -- all sorts of things designed to take hitters by surprise. Lefties get a good look at his fastball because of Crouse's low slot, and the velo he would theoretically gain out of the bullpen (he was up to 102 out of the bullpen in a 2017 All-Star Game) would give him the margin for error he needs to not be crushed by them.

Instead, the questions now surround his ability to make contact. Even during his torrid, 30-game stretch to start 2019, Huff was striking out about 30% of the time, his career rate. It's a problem caused by the combination of his aggressiveness and middling barrel accuracy, and he looked overmatched against big league arms this spring, striking out in half his at-bats. But Huff has superlative power that plays when he does make contact and he can play not only a premium position, but the most barren offensive position in the game right now.

Acosta's tools aren't showcase-friendly. He has uncommon barrel control and his swing is not only suited for him to make contact at the top of the strike zone, it's also where he does most of his damage. He's vulnerable down and away, where he ends up cutting at balls on a decline and driving them into the ground, but lower-level pitching won't be able to exploit that consistently. For a someone still shy of age 18, Acosta is pretty stocky and strong. If his build stays this way, it improves his chances of staying on the middle infield but also caps his raw power close to average. Regardless of which marginal side of average his power ends up settling on, the contact is what's going to drive Acosta's prospectdom, and based on fall looks that aspect could be special.","Ewa6drN9XGs",

There are some long-term questions about that build because Lora is so huge for a prospect his age and reports about his conditioning while he was an amateur were mixed, but he looked svelte last fall and his relative physical maturity also gives him a better chance of moving quickly through the minors. He often has clumsy in-the-box footwork but deft hitting hands. Last fall, he took several ugly-looking, unbalanced swings but still found a way to get the barrel there, and even when he miss-hits balls they're still put in play hard because of how strong Lora is.

Despite measuring maybe -- <em>maybe</em> -- 5-foot-10 (maybe), his arm generates mid-90s velocity he has relatively advanced command of. He's not a touch and feel strike-thrower; he comes right after hitters at the letters. He also has great feel for locating a breaking ball (though it lacks impact movement), his split/change has natural tumble, and he's so athletic and well-balanced throughout his delivery that you can kind of go nuts projecting on his command.

He hit pretty well despite skipping the Northwest League and heading right to full season ball as an 18-year-old, slashing .257/.333/.373 with a bunch of doubles. I'm still not entirely keen on Johnny O's bat path, which I think will make it hard for him to hit for everyday power if left unaltered, but he's an excellent rotational athlete who I think will find ways to hit the ball hard all over the field, while he plays several different positions.","b9ZQIBiRLBs","sa3006909"

The gap power Moss currently generates from both sides of the plate is surprising considering how physically overmatched he was when he first came stateside for 2018 instructs. Perhaps more impressive is how deft his bat control is as a teenage switch-hitter. He pairs an athletic leg kick with very simple hitting hands that he simply guides toward the ball, turning his wrists over through contact and whacking low-lying contact to all fields. Moss can still run, but his infield hands are not good. Optimistic scouts have him eventually passing at second base, while I have him projected to the outfield.","JL9e7YVE21I","sa3005599"

He also dealt with a thumb injury late during his college career that shelved him for some of last summer. By the late summer and during instructs, Wendzel was not only fully healthy but clearly in peak physical condition, and he and his tawny Amish beard and mullet were instrumental in the Rangers AZL title run. Though he has a high maintenance build, Wendzel's hands and actions might enable him to a play a passable shift-aided middle infield spot if he remains as agile as he looked late last year, which again is much different than just a few years ago when he was built more softly and playing some first base and left field.

He does hit the ball hard (43% of his balls in play last year were hit over 95 mph according to a source) but he can be pitched to in a way that limits the damage he does. 
In many ways, Walker projects to be a player quite similar to the one Mazara has become. His platoon splits have been rather significant to this point and his in-game power production is likely to end up beneath his raw (albeit for reasons different than Mazara’s, which have to do with pitch selection more than swing plane issues), though Walker is a superior defender.

A short season, or perhaps no minor league season at all, makes it unlikely that Speas has the multi-month opportunity to do that, and teams would likely be hesitant to pop him in the Rule 5 considering how little he has pitched the last couple of years.
