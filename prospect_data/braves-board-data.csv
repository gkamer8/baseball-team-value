He had a 17% swinging strike rate last year (if we 20-80'd swinging strike rates, that'd be a 30), and you might quibble with elements of the swing, most notably that the bat path only allows for power in certain parts of the zone, and Pache has a passive, shorter move forward. The hand speed and rotational ability to hit for power is there, and he's athletic enough to make adjustments in order to get to that power (selectivity might also be an issue), which, coupled with some of the flashiest, most acrobatic defense in pro baseball, gives Pache a cathedral ceiling. 
Even though he's already started to slow down a little bit, Pache's reads in center, his contortionistic ability to slide and dive at odd angles to make tough catches, and his arm strength combine to make him a premium defensive center fielder -- he's a likely Gold Glover barring unexpected, precipitous physical regression. Even if he's not posting All-Star offensive statlines, we think he'll provide All-Star value overall because of the glove.","ALCsGpZ1oiA","sa916722"

He's got 55-to-60 grade tools across the board and always hit in high school. Some teams were and remain turned off by his loud personality, while others just see him as a colorful guy. The other concern is his aggressive approach at the plate, which didn't give him any trouble until his taste of Triple-A late in 2019, and some scouts and analysts think it could be a problem in the big leagues. 
That's the soft part of the profile, but the indicators both to the eye (scouts rave about the swing, bat speed, and feel at the plate) and in the stats point to elite ability to manipulate the bat. One club told us his percentage of balls hit with 95 mph-plus exit velo and a launch angle between 10 and 30 degrees (i.e. hard hit line drives and fly balls) was in the top 3% of the entire minor leagues. And that comes as a 20-year-old in the upper minors who has plus speed and a plus arm, and who profiles in center field, with other variables that could allow you to keep rounding up from there. The happy version of this story is Starling Marte, and as soon as the middle of 2020; the sad version includes multiple years stuck in neutral at the big league level, trying to argue that the upside and defense makes up for the big strikeout rate. We're leaning more to Marte at this point.","lNnHDBf17DI","sa3004378"

The pitch with the most obvious beauty is his shapely curveball, which has enough depth (despite its paltry spin rate) to miss bats in the zone, and also pairs well with his fastball's approach angle. His change has tail and fade, and either it or the curve can finish hitters. The Braves amateur department really stuck out their necks in 2016 by cutting an underslot deal with Anderson, and then using the savings to sign Kyle Muller and Bryse Wilson, who are both key near-term pitching staff stalwarts, and Joey Wentz, who was traded. That's an impressive class, especially considering how risky a subgroup prep pitching is.","tgygzB4auuw","sa917921"

We're betting that Wright, who is very athletic and has the frame and mechanical ease to eat innings, and who has also developed a very deep repertoire, will find a way to be at least a league-average starter eventually. Whether that's through further changes to his fastballs' movement (he throws a four- and two-seamer right now, but both are sink/tail pitches rather than the ride/vertical life breed) or a heavy mix of his various secondary offerings, Wright has promising outs. If he and the Braves ever find a way to make the fastball play better than that, his ceiling is substantial, so there's rare variance for a 24-year-old here.","e4af0nTNiFI","19665"

He's an aggressive bulldog with a football background who relies on spotting his fastball in all quadrants of the zone, with the velocity, movement, and command all grading above average on his various fastballs (he has a distinct four-seamer, two-seamer, and cutter). He's a solid athlete with strong command and a solid average changeup, and everyone raves about his work ethic and makeup. 
The issue, which will dictate his value in the bullpen or rotation, is his breaking ball. He's been working on the slider all offseason and the team is optimistic that all his other strong qualities will manifest themselves in its development. Wilson will be limited to one time through the order if he can't live up to that optimism, though it's not as if there isn't value in that, and Wilson's mentality might arguably be better suited for it.","-W1-8t94J3M","19990"

The Braves pushed him quickly -- half a year at Hi-A, half at Double-A at age 21 -- and the developmental priority seems to be defense for now. Contreras also has quite a bit more raw power than his 2019 output would suggest. His swing is a lot like Pache's right now, which is indicative of some of his issues but also how athletic Contreras is for a catcher. He can drop the bat head and yank balls out to his pull side at times, then lunge at breaking stuff away from him at others. It's rare physical talent for a catcher who projects as Atlanta's everyday backstop.","6knO4tYP-LM","sa872847"

After improving his body composition entering the 2017 season, his stuff and command improved too, and he looked like a potential no. 4 starter. After plateauing at that level for a bit, Davidson's 2019 represented another step forward. He ran his heater up to 98 during the regular season, then got some attention weeks ago when he hit 100 mph at Driveline on a motion capture-enabled mound. His four-seam fastball has big rise and velocity, while his curveball has plus spin and his slider is 88-91 mph, with all three garnering strong results in terms of whiffs and grounders. The main adjustments in this bump were mechanical, with another round of refinements to his frame. There's now mid-rotation upside, and Davidson has reached Triple-A as the optimization process is now closer to complete.","ScF_t-apuls","sa918393"

He still didn't put up much in the way of traditional statistical production until the second half of his junior season, which amazingly occurred after a very quick return from a broken hamate bone. He was scouted heavily over the summer with Team USA, so scouts knew solid average raw power and some feel for contact were present to go along with above average defensive skills and a plus arm. 
Langeliers' frame is compact and stout, and his bat's impact is a question mark, but he has everyday tools and more power should come in 2020 with the broken hamate in the rear view.","SyejX3eoyUM","sa3010329"

Some clubs were down on him and we piled on by moving him down in our rankings just before Day 1, seeing a non-shortstop with a track record of hitting but without much power or any loft, who seemed one-dimensional given a swing that often barred-out. It would appear that point of view was wrong, given Shewmake's quick transition to pro ball, which better showcased his ability. He went straight to Low-A after signing and was outstanding at the plate, with an excellent approach and sneaky power, to go along with very positive public and private defensive metrics at shortstop. 
The key gap between the two points of view was tied to Shewmake's long frame: his long stride made his speed, defensive range, and defensive instincts seem less impressive and impactful, when in reality, they may all be plus. There's also raw power upside if there's more physical development and a possible loft/swing adjustment, and that now seems more likely given how advanced, instinctual, and coachable he's proven to be so far. There's a good bit more variability here than you'd expect for a college hitter with a three-year major conference track record, so the first half of 2020 will let us know if there's more helium left in this balloon.","2MvPIsIO4PQ","sa3010332"

His stuff is great, especially the fastball, which has one of the highest spin rates in the minors. Muller's delivery has become less staccato, less deliberate, and more athletic, but his max-effort style and difficulty repeating likely pushes him to the bullpen, or at least keeps his innings count down if he ends up starting.","GHdft_9H-90","sa917931"

His epicurean approach at the plate, and what it does to his peripherals, makes Jackson a hit-tool risk, and at most other positions that would be very scary. But while he is still not a great catcher, the Braves are determined to keep playing him there and soon, if an automated strike zone is instituted, some of his issues will suddenly be moot. The league average wRC+ at catcher before framing quantification was in the low 90s. If things return to that level, Jackson's power should enable him to profile everyday. He may be more of a backup, DH/1B sort for a few years and fall into an everyday role toward the end of our six-year evaluation window.","HIPG1LxMnlQ","17276"

The Braves preferred Harris as a hitter most of the spring. He blew them away in a private pre-draft workout, showing plus raw power, making him a priority on draft day. He also beat expectations in his pro debut, and there's now some thought that he could be a center fielder as he gets more instruction, and may get faster as he gets stronger. There's no bad data to consider due to his lack of exposure before his draft spring, so some would see Harris as a comp round pick in a 2019 redraft.

Vodnik is a good athlete with plus extension, particularly for his size, and he'll run his heater up to 100 while mixing in a plus breaking ball and throwing more strikes than Jasseel De La Cruz. But Vodnik is still on the smaller side, and is more butcher than surgeon.
