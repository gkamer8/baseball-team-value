"Tyler Soderstrom","OAK","1B","A",57,0,"&uarr;","50",2025,"High","19.5305555","6' 2""","200","L","R",2020,"Draft","OAK",3300000,"Turlock HS (CA)","Soderstom is the best prospect I saw during big league and minor league spring training, and this was the case for many scouts, as well. He looked comfortable during his big league spring at-bats and was utterly dominant on the backfields, running deep counts and crushing hard fly balls and line drives to all fields. Even when forced to offer at pitcher's pitches he's strong enough to rip the ball through the right side of the defense. This just adds to a long track record of hitting that dates back to Soderstrom's amateur days, though Soderstom has already become much more physical than he was in high school, and he stands apart from most other prospects on the field, even in pro ball. Juxtaposing his advanced offense is Soderstrom's defense. He split time behind the plate on his high school team, then was asked to catch premium stuff from pitchers with whom he had no experience during his showcase summer. I think we've only seen the tip of his defensive iceberg, but working to develop Soderstrom glove probably means slowing the development of his bat, and exposing him to the brutal grind of catching which often dilutes offensive production. He took a foul ball off the shoulder this spring, collapsed into a heap, and was removed. This is the sort of thing that might cause him to play through pain and not hit as well for long stretches. Some teams wanted to run him out as a corner outfielder or third baseman, and he's also played a bunch of first base so far this year. I think the Wil Myers/Bryce Harper approach would make a ton of sense here. It would probably help Soderstrom traverse the minors more quickly and overlap in the big leagues with Sean Murphy, who is a fantastic defender unlikely to be supplanted by anyone, let alone a fringe defender sort like Soderstrom.

"A.J. Puk","OAK","SP","AAA",99,0,,"50",2021,"High","26.1111111","6' 7""","230","L","L",2016,"Draft","OAK",4069200,"Florida","Puk has now missed the better part of the last three seasons due to a Tommy John surgery (2018), subsequent rehab (most of 2019), and persistent shoulder problems (2020) that culminated in a September 2020 surgery. Because it was not a reconstructive surgery (he had a labral and rotator cuff debridement and bursitis cleanup), the A's and Puk's doctor (Neal ElAttrache) are optimistic the left-hander will be able to be an impact part of the pitching staff in 2021, and he pitched during the back half of spring training, albeit with dimished velocity. Long a softer-bodied guy, Puk spent the offseason training at Cressey Sports Performance in Florida and now looks lean and cut. A return to form would mean Puk is sitting 94-97 (harder out of the bullpen, if that's how he's used) with a plus slider, above-average changeup, and a curveball that was re-introduced to his repertoire in pro ball after it had been shelved in college. His first 2021 outing was more 92-93 with his typical impact array of secondary stuff. He still hasn't been able to work deep enough in games for his repertoire depth to matter, and the long layoff may cause Oakland to ease him back into an innings load by way of a limited role throughout the year. This is the first time Puk has appeared on a FanGraphs list and not been a 55 FV prospect. <em>(Alternate Site)</em>","dF78XZniyhY","19343"
