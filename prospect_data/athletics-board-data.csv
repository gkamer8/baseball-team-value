"Jesus Luzardo","OAK","LHP","MLB",6,1,,"60",2020,,"22.7888888","5' 11""","209","L","L",2016,"Draft","WAS",1400000,"Stoneman Douglas HS (FL)","The summer before his senior year of high school, Luzardo looked like a relatively unprojectable pitchability lefty, albeit an advanced one. His fastball was only in the 88-92 range at Area Codes, though his changeup and curveball were each above-average. He did not throw during the fall and instead devoted more time to working out. The following spring, with a new physique, Luzardo's stuff was way up across the board, his fastball now sitting comfortably in the mid-90s, and touching 97. Four starts into his senior season, Luzardo tore his UCL and needed Tommy John. 
After most of the first three rounds of the 2016 draft had come and gone, it seemed as though Luzardo might end up at the University of Miami. Four outings (including the one during which he broke) wasn't enough for many teams to have high-level decision makers get in to see him and want to take him early, but the Nationals (who have a history of drafting pitchers who have fallen due to injury) called his name and signed him for $1.4 million, a bonus equivalent to an early second rounder. Luzardo rehabbed as a National and when he returned the following summer, his stuff had completely returned. He made just three starts for the GCL Nats before he was traded to Oakland as part of the Sean Doolittle/Ryan Madson deal. 
After a dominant first full year in Oakland's system, Luzardo appeared poised to seize a rotation spot early in 2019, when suddenly, the very contagious injury bug that has bedeviled Oakland pitching prospects for the last several years infected his shoulder and, later during rehab, his lat. He was confined to early-morning sim games on the Mesa backfields until June, when he was sent to rehab at Hi-A Stockton and then to Triple-A Nashville, where Luzardo's pitch count climbed back to typical starter norms. Oakland 'penned him for September, a multi-inning weapon for the stretch and playoff run. He was sitting 94-96 and touched 99 as a starter in the minors, the same as he was out of the big league bullpen. It's a sinker, but it has barrel-shattering tail and pairs nicely with both of Luzardo's secondaries, which live at the bottom of the zone and beneath it. He'll add and subtract from his breaking ball to give it a curveball shape that bends into the zone for strikes, or add power to it and coax hitters into waiving at pitches that finish well out of the zone. His changeup is firm but has late bottom and should also miss bats. The violence in Luzardo's delivery combined with his injury history is slightly worrisome, but he was clearly operating at full speed late last year and has top-of-the-rotation stuff and pitchability, so his 60 FV has that risk baked in.","XPMeIpPKW2k","19959"

His delivery was more balanced and repeatable, and he rebooted his old high school curveball, which he hadn't used in college, and quickly reclaimed the feel for locating it; his changeup was also plus at times, much better than it was when he was an amateur. Then he tore his UCL and needed Tommy John, which kept him out for all of 2018 and most of 2019. Throughout the spring of 2019, you could just show up to Fitch Park in Mesa and run into one of Luzardo, Puk, James Kaprielian, or any of several other high-profile A's rehabbers. Puk got into game action in April and May, throwing as many as four innings in an outing (that I'm aware of, anyway) before he was finally sent to an affiliate in June, but only in a two-inning start or bullpen capacity. He never threw more than 47 pitches in an outing and was limited to 20 or 30 bullets when the A's finally called him up in September. He threw fewer curveballs in that role than he theoretically will as a starter, making that pitch tough to evaluate when he returned, but all the other weapons are intact, and Puk should contribute to Oakland's rotation in 2020 assuming there's a season. He projects as an above-average big league starter.","dF78XZniyhY","19343"
"Sean Murphy","OAK","C","MLB",65,3,,"50",2020,,"25.7611111","6' 3""","232","R","R",2016,"Draft","OAK",,"Wright State","Murphy's surgeries are starting to pile up. He's had them for broken hamates in both hands, then was cut again in October because of his meniscus. Purely on tools, he's a 55 FV prospect and it's amazing that he's gone from a walk-on at Wright State to one of the more well-rounded catching prospects in the minors. But the injuries, Murphy's age (some of the sixish years I'm projecting here include his early 30s now), and the fact that some of his skills (he's become a good receiver) may soon be less important caused me to round down. 
Now if he starts hitting for more power in games, that's a horse of a different color. He has plus raw power, though he hasn't typically hit for it in games for various reasons. In college, his first broken hamate likely masked his thump and was part of the reason he fell to the 2016 draft's third round. He had the second hamate break in pro ball and his swing is also very compact, relying on Murphy's raw strength rather than efficient biomechanical movement to deliver extra-bases. He could be an above-average regular early on but I think there will be a little attrition over time, so I slid him back behind some players who I think have a higher long-term ceiling.","tVv3ORj53mQ","19352"

He has a chance to have plus tools across the board, but there's some industry sentiment that in-game aptitude might cause those tools to play down. Specifically, there's worry about his approach at the plate, which will be more problematic if Puason outgrows shortstop. He had already arrived in Mesa before the shutdown and had clearly been in the weight room during the offseason, which was especially evident in his shoulders.","P07YG46Wi30",

He's a big, switch-hitting 6-foot-3 shortstop (likely to stay there) with above-average power from both sides of the plate. He hasn't hit for that sort of power with wood bats (he slugged just .266 both years on the Cape, .332 last summer) but that may be a stamina issue rather than a wood vs. composite one. There's some hit tool risk here, and if Davidson ends up as a 30 or 35 bat in pro ball, he'll probably end up as a utility guy, but if he's making close to an even average amount of contact, he's probably playing every day.","CIxwpUggH0Y","sa918676"

He made lots of quality contact during his showcase summer and is one of the more polished high school hitters in this draft. Juxtaposing his advanced offense is Soderstrom's defense. He split time behind the plate on his high school team, then was asked to catch premium stuff from pitchers with whom he had no experience during his showcase summer. I think we've only seen the tip of his defensive iceberg, but working to develop Soderstrom glove probably means slowing the development of his bat, and exposing him to the brutal grind of catching which often dilutes offensive production. The track record for high school catchers is pretty scary but it makes sense that the teams that like Soderstrom most think he can do it.",,

His injury history impacts his value pretty severely. Purely on talent, Jefferies is arguably a top 100 prospect (and was a 2019 Pick to Click before the latest hiccup) thanks largely to his plus, upper-80s changeup and plus command. Jefferies terse, upper-80s slider is effective because of his ability to locate it, and the rest of his repertoire, with precision. If healthy, he'll likely contribute to the big club this year, but that's a significant ""if.""","ij14-6H6bPU","sa738964"
"Nick Allen","OAK","SS",,,8,,"45",2022,,"21.7666666","5' 9""","166","R","R",2017,"Draft","OAK",,"Francis Parker HS (CA)","One of the best high school shortstop defenders many scouts have ever seen, Allen's size, or lack there of, is why he fell to the draft's third round, as there was concern he would not have the requisite physicality to hit big league pitching. After a few years of pro ball, Allen's wrists and forearms have become strong enough to put viable contact in play (and he makes plenty of it), though probably not with enough force to truly profile as an everyday shortstop. 
He's quite similar to fellow punchless leatherwizard José Iglesias, and could be a 1.5-ish WAR everyday player like Iglesias has been, but Allen started seeing time at second base and (in the Fall League) third base for the first time as a pro, and could also be an elite defensive utility infielder.","LdNKp8Xs1s0","sa3004723"

Instead, he's got an advanced, well-rounded game and hit .300/.392/.506 in the AZL last year despite being two and a half years younger than the average player in that league. Yes, <em>two and a half years</em> younger than the average AZL player. Buelvas turns 18 today. His skillset is going to be augmented by how he physically matures. This isn't a player with overt, striking physical projection like Kristian Robinson or any other 6-foot-3 prospect. Buelvas is an angular 5-foot-11, certainly likely to get bigger and stronger but probably not grow into huge power. He might hit 15 to 20 homers via consistent, quality contact, though. He's fast and instinctive enough to stay in center field, so that would be all the power he needs to develop to play every day. His report reads a lot like contact/instincts high schoolers available in the 2020 draft -- Pete Crow-Armstrong, Robert Hassell, Petey Halpin -- and I have him valued in that range.",,"sa3008868"

He had a rough 2018, his first at Triple-A, then went bonkers in Vegas last year, slashing .317/.389/.550 with 60 extra-base hits in 126 games. He struggled during a brief big league stint (lion's share of the reps there came at second base after playing mostly third in Triple-A) but didn't get consistent at-bats outside of the first week of September. While I think the dramatic strikeout rate dip last year will probably regress to the mean, he's going to be a valuable, multi-positional player (2B/3B with maybe some left, and shortstop in a pinch) with power.","qqp5Daofb6w","19635"

Remember, Beck had almost zero experience against elite high school pitching (he missed his showcase summer with a torn ACL) and was purely drafted based on the tools he showed during his senior spring. He's only had two season's worth of at-bats against pro-quality pitching, and (hopefully) he's still adjusting. To that end, his ability to identify balls and strikes remains undercooked and it has undermined his performance in spite of blaring physical gifts. He still has power and arm strength but he's swing-happy in the box, his swing is not yet geared for in-game power, and Beck is sometimes visibly frustrated, which appears to cause some of his approach issues to snowball. Again, Beck is only 21 and if you consider not only his relative inexperience but also his age (he was a 20-year-old at Hi-A in 2019 and was still nearly a league-average offensive player), there are reasons to be optimistic for late growth.","oAS3Hzfb8Jc","sa3004055"

His velocity was in the 88-91 range during Extended and then the 90-94 range during the summer. This spring, he was sitting 92-95, and while that's not where Kap's heater was at peak, it's an encouraging sign for someone whose injury track record is as long as anyone's in baseball. He missed nearly all of 2016 due to a flexor-tendon strain, blew out his UCL during 2017 spring training and needed Tommy John, then was shut back down with shoulder soreness in 2018 during rehab, and finally had more shoulder soreness early last year. So long as he has his spring velo if and when baseball returns, I think he'll be a core member of Oakland's staff in short order, possibly in multi-inning relief based on his 2019 usage.","hFv_4TVJwyE","sa658943"

Some of his issues might be rendered moot by the eventual use of an electronic strike zone, but for now Allen’s reps need to be limited the way Evan Gattis’ were when he was seeing regular playing time, pairing him with pitchers who work in such a way that Allen’s problems are masked. With 26-man rosters coming, his presence as a third catcher, a late-inning lefty bench bat, a late-inning catcher when the A’s trail, or an occasional DH sub for Khris Davis against righties all make him immediately rosterable. He profiles as a bit player who does that sort of thing rather than an everyday catcher or first baseman.","ygdkd-KMtXE","18083"

The quality of his at-bats has improved over the last couple of years and he's pretty likely to play a big league role this year since Sean Murphy has had some issues staying on the field and Austin Allen isn't a good defender. He might be more valuable than a 40 FV in the short-term because he's a good framer, but if balls and strikes are soon called by tech, he's probably more of a third catcher.",,"sa737843"

His changeup has fairly consistent fading action that mirrors the best of those fastballs, but his upper-70s, two-plane curveball is the headline pitch, and flashes plus.

His stuff is pretty generic — 89-93 with an average cutter and curveball — but Howard’s size (he’s 6-foot-9) creates a unique angle on his pitches that hitters clearly aren’t comfortable with. He also has remarkable control for a pitcher of this size. It's fifth or sixth starter stuff, which would already be a great outcome for a high-priority senior sign, and I'm inclined to round to the top of that range based on the weirdness created by Howard's height and his purported competitiveness.",,"sa918377"

He was often seen by high-level decision makers during that breakout because he was playing alongside first round third baseman Jake Burger, and he had 2018 first round buzz by the end of the college postseason because scouts thought he could be a passable shortstop with all-fields power, and analytics folks liked his huge season and higher-than-you'd-expect exit velos. Then Eierman had an inconsistent summer with Team USA and his draft spring was a bit of a letdown. He plateaued, arguably had a worse statistical season, and suddenly there were doubts about his approach and ultimate defensive home. He fell to 70th overall.

He barely threw at an affiliate, and so was most widely seen during instructional league, where he was a fluid and easy 93-97, with good nascent secondary stuff. He had a strong 2019 in the mid-minors and I thought he deserved Rule 5 consideration, but he went unselected.",,"sa736686"
"Lazaro Armenteros","OAK","LF","A+",,34,,"35+",2021,,"21.1444444","6' 0""","182","R","R",2016,"J2","OAK",,"Cuba","There are scouts and front office personnel who see Lazarito's strikeout issues (he punched out 42% of the time last year) as entirely disqualifying, and clearly his ability to make contact needs to improve dramatically if he's going to be any kind of big leaguer. He still has a rare power/speed blend, though, and I think his issues have more to do with swing path than anything else,which is more fixable than, say, issues caused by pitch recognition. His cut is fairly similar to what Luis Robert's was before Robert and the White Sox made relevant adjustments to his mechanics, so I'm holding onto some optimism for Armenteros, though it has largely dwindled throughout the industry.","vc84x37Htwg","sa969091"

He has a well-balanced lower half but he lacks tactile feel for release, which impacts his command. His upper body rotates in unison like a tilt-a-whirl, and his low 3/4s arm slot generates mediocre angle on his fastball but nasty, two-plane movement on his slider.","0MkhFZuO1H4","sa875839"

Thick and physical throughout the torso and thighs, Varland has a lightning-quick arm that generates mid-90s velocity at peak. His fastball has bat-missing life, and both his breaking balls have sufficient bite to avoid barrels as well, especially when they're well-located. He had Tommy John last August and will miss all of 2020.",,"sa3007779"
