"Brennen Davis","CHC","CF","AA",39,0,,"55",2023,"High","21.5916666","6' 4""","175","R","R",2018,"Draft","CHC",1100000,"Basha HS (AZ)","Davis made an incredible leap during his first year in pro ball. Some area scouts thought he was so raw as a hitter, and that his stock had fallen enough due to a pre-draft hamstring issue, that he might be better off going to school. The Cubs took him in the second round, tweaked his swing, and skipped him over a level; he responded by hitting .305/.381/.525 at South Bend, and he may just be scratching the surface. 
Davis was his conference's Defensive POY on a 2016 state championship basketball team and he didn't fully commit to baseball until his senior year of high school. He has a big, projectable frame that he's already added a lot of muscle to over the last year and a half, and amateur scouts raved about Davis' maturity as a student and a worker (often citing the odd hours he keeps taking care of a goat and the llamas at his family home), and all thought he'd be able to cope with likely early-career contact struggles and would work to improve his ability to hit. Watch out for the injuries here. In addition to the hamstring issue in high school, Davis was on the IL twice in 2019 for hand ailments. We only have a 50-game sample of stats, but it's just evidence supporting the athletic/makeup foundation and reinforcing that the swing change worked. This is a risk/reward power/speed outfield prospect. Davis was listed on the Cubs instructs roster but I can only find scouts who saw him take BP in Arizona, so I'm not sure whether or not he played in games. <em>(Alternate site)</em>","6gBtKoXW5Gc","sa3007876"
"Brailyn Marquez","CHC","SIRP","AA",112,0,,"50",2021,"High","22.3472222","6' 4""","240","L","L",2015,"J2","CHC",600000,"Dominican Republic","There's very little to be gleaned from Marquez's horrendous big league debut except to say that the lack of mechanical consistency he displayed in that outing is the sort of thing I've seen from him pretty often on the backfields, and is a large part of why I have him projected as a single-inning reliever. Elite velocity carries Marquez's profile. His heater averaged 95.6 mph in 2019 and was parked at 97.8 in 2020, and there are only a half-dozen lefties on the planet who throw that hard. Marquez walked 13% of Low-A hitters over 17 starts in 2019 but was promoted to Hi-A anyway because he was just bullying hitters with heat and not really refining anything else. The Cubs have tried to get his lower- and upper-halves to synch better in the hopes that it will help him pepper the zone more consistently, and there have been fits and starts where it looks like things have clicked only to regress, similar to the way Phillipe Aumont's consistency did during his prospect peak. Marquez's changeup has bat-missing action and his arm slot makes his slider tough on lefties, though it's not a good pitch in a vacuum and both of his secondary offerings are typically dependent on location. There really aren't big league starters with this kind of build (especially at this age) and lack of athleticism, but there also aren't many pitchers who throw this hard. Still just 22, I expect Marquez will eventually find a consistent second pitch and work in a high-leverage relief role. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>","XeLTg0oFKog","21896"
"Reginald Preciado","CHC","3B",,130,0,,"50",2025,"High","18.0527777","6' 4""","180","S","R",2019,"J2","SDP",1300000,"Panama","The Padres gave Preciado a $1.3 million bonus in 2019, a record for a Panamanian prospect because he had the overt physical traits that teams have traditionally coveted on the international market. He’s a big-framed (about 6-foot-4) switch-hitter who is athletic enough to stay on the infield. Players like this have a wide range of potential outcomes, with one being that their body develops in the Goldilocks Zone where they remain agile enough to stay at shortstop, and also become big and strong enough to hit for impact power. Though some teams have shown evidence of a philosophical shift in this area, prospects like Preciado are the ones who typically get paid the most money on the international market. 
When Preciado came to the States for 2019 instructs, he looked like you’d expect a 16-year-old his size to look: raw and uncoordinated. He still had not gained athletic dominion over his frame, and he looked much more like a third base defender than a shortstop. Fast forward a year (because there was no minor league season) to the Fall of 2020 and Preciado now has a batting stance and swing that look an awful lot like Corey Seager’s. It allows him to be relatively short to the baseball despite his lever length, and whether it had to do with the swing change or not, he looked much more comfortable in the box this Fall than he did last year. Because of the missing minor league season, most teams in Arizona brought an older contingent of player to instructs than they usually would, and still Preciado (who is still just 17) was striking the ball with precision and power from both sides of the plate when he made contact. He had real issues recognizing breaking balls during the Fall and his ability to adjust to those will be key moving forward, but I'm willing to bet it was a symptom of him being 17 and facing unusually advanced pitching after not having seen any live pitching at all for much of the year. I still think he ends up at third, but there’s rare hit/power combination potential here and it just takes confidence in one’s eyes to see it might already have arrived. He was the best prospect the Cubs acquired for Yu Darvish. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em>","KwU4e2Gwrts","sa3014702"
