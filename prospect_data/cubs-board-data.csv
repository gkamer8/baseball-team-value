"Nico Hoerner","CHC","2B","MLB",47,1,,"50",2020,,"23.1694444","5' 11""","200","R","R",2018,"Draft","CHC",2724000,"Stanford","When Hoerner was at Stanford, it seemed reasonable to hope that he could pass as a shortstop by simply making all the routine plays, plus a few based on his level of effort. It also seemed reasonable to project him in center field because of his plus-plus speed. The Cubs have decided to have it both ways; beginning in July of last year, after he returned from a wrist fracture, they began playing him at all three up-the-middle positions. Barring a rep-based leap in center field, he projects to be a 45 defender at all three spots, but the versatility is valuable on its own. 
This wasn't the first developmental alteration the Cubs made. Hoerner's swing changed not long after he was drafted. He was making lots of hard, low-lying contact at Stanford, but since signing he has added a subtle little bat wrap that has made a substantial difference in how he impacts the ball. He hit for much more power than was anticipated after he signed and may not have repeated the SLG in 2019 because of the wrist injury. He's a lock regular for me and has some hidden value because of the defensive flexibility he provides, assuming he proves capable of handling both short and center.","W6oDgCR-O3c","21479"

Some area scouts thought he was so raw as a hitter, and that his stock had fallen enough due to a pre-draft hamstring issue, that he might be better off going to school. The Cubs took him in the second round, tweaked his swing, and skipped him over a level; he responded by hitting .305/.381/.525 at South Bend, and he may just be scratching the surface. 
Davis was his conference's Defensive POY on a 2016 state championship basketball team and didn't fully commit to baseball until his senior year of high school. He has a big, projectable frame that he's already added a lot of muscle to over the last year and a half, and amateur scouts raved about Davis' maturity as a student and a worker (often citing the odd hours he keeps taking care of a goat and the llamas at his family home), and all thought he'd be able to cope with likely early-career contact struggles and would work to improve his ability to hit. Watch out for the injuries here. In addition to the hamstring issue in high school, Davis was on the IL twice last year for hand ailments. We only have a 50-game sample of stats, but it's just evidence supporting the athletic/makeup foundation and reinforcing that the swing change worked. This is a risk/reward power/speed outfield prospect.","6gBtKoXW5Gc","sa3007876"

He remains a polished defender with leadership qualities befitting an everyday backstop, and his body is built to withstand the rigors of the dog days. Like most catchers, Amaya's offensive tools play down a bit in games because the position wreaks havoc on the body. For two years now he's caught about 90 games, reached base at a .350 clip, and hit a dozen dingers. He's now on the 40-man and was on pace to play at Double-A this year before the shutdown, though his big league timeline might accelerate if Willson Contreras is traded.","ALRAn-JhLgA","sa917354"

He walked 13% of Low-A hitters over 17 starts but was promoted to Hi-A anyway because he was just bullying hitters with heat and not really refining anything. Marquez does unleash the occasionally nasty slider, his changeup sometimes has bat-missing tail and location, and, though it's unclear if it's purposeful or not, his throws what looks like a cutter.

That pitching is much better than what Howard would have seen in Illinois this spring. Howard best squares up pitches at the bottom of the strike zone, and although he hasn't been tested regularly at the letters, he's shown flashes of being able to either lay off those pitches, or pull his hands in and find a way to get the barrel there, and even to catch that high pitch way out in front of the plate and hit it in the air to his pull side. Whether Howard is able to do that against big league velocity is tough to predict, but he has promising feel to hit and an advance approach for a cold weather hitter, as well as perhaps the best defensive footwork in the entire class. He projects as an everday big league shortstop.",,

He was given extended rest and had his pitch counts limited late in the summer of 2017 before he was shut down in August, then he had a PRP injection in 2018 after he was diagnosed with a lat strain, and had biceps inflammation in 2019. It's the lone reason he's not on the top 100. He has this system's best two-pitch mix, a fastball/power curveball combo that would pretty cleanly profile in the back of the bullpen if the Cubs want to move him there for health reasons. He threw his changeup much more during his 2019 big league time than I would have guessed. He has feel for creating movement on it but not for locating it competitively. He has mid-rotation upside assuming good health and a little more changeup refinement, which is reasonable to hope for because he's lost reps to all these injuries.","hnS3Oz08Xc4","17859"

He added a bunch of good weight and strength and had significantly more raw power when he arrived in the AZL after signing, and had already begun trading a little bit of contact for significantly more game power. He skipped the Northwest League, went right to full season ball, and didn't perform statistically, but I'm not moving off of him at all. Roederer creates a lot of power in a short amount of space and I'm still bullish about him hitting for a mix of contact and power. If he can stay in center field, he'll be an everyday player, but I think he's more likely to end up in left. Even if that's the case, I think he'll be the larger half of a platoon pretty easily, and I also think he has a shot to outhit my projection and just profile everyday in left, too.","ohp5N8Ys_Ik","sa3008184"

The compact nature of his swing increases the likelihood that he's going to hit, and he also has sneaky strength in his hands that should help him produce at least doubles power. His median outcome is probably that of a second division regular or utility man; if he's better than that it'll be because he hit more than anticipated.","DLf_mW0oZQs","sa3010845"

His secondaries are not as nasty, but they're workable and flash average right now. There's a lot pointing to a relief role here because of the size, delivery (Jensen's arm action is very long), and the reality that two pitches need to develop for him to start, but the fastball gives him a chance to be a high-leverage or multi-inning reliever.","oQKQsrt6oL0","sa3011496"

His scouting reports still lead with affection for his command rather than his improved stuff, but there was thought that the stuff might continue to blossom in pro ball. Instead it has plateaued, and Abbott now projects as a low-variance fifth starter. His fastball plays best when it's moving most, which for him is when he's locating it just off the plate to his arm side; it is hittable everywhere else, including up above the zone. He can locate there, but Abbott is limited in where he can attack with the heater, which also makes it harder for him to set up his breaking balls, the best of which is an above-average curveball.

He also showed a very rotational, whippy swing with natural, pull-side loft, so he might hit for power without any sort of swing alteration.

Pinango takes some pretty erratic swings and often loses his balance through contact because of how hard he's rotating, but it didn't hurt his ability to make contact last year and lots of guys, Cody Belligner most notably, have successfully dialed down their swings without compromising their power output. Pinango isn't that kind of athlete (who is?) nor is his frame all that projectable. He's pretty curvaceous for an 18-year-old, so I'm a little bearish on his ultimate power projection and think there's some risk he moves to a corner despite his present speed.

He's already physically maxed out and has fairly limited range at second base, and his lateral agility might be a problem if he keeps getting bigger and slows down. For now, I think his hands and actions are good enough to continue projecting him as a shift-aided second baseman. If so, then he at least projects as a role player similar to Short and Giambrone, albeit one with a little less defensive versatility. Martinez can contact pitches at the top of the zone and go down and lift balls at the bottom. His righty swing is a little more linear and line drive-y than the left.

His 2018 season, when he took some of the toughest at-bats in the AZL as a 17-year-old, was not dissimilar from that of players like Tucupita Marcano and Bryan Rocchio, who have both progressed well. Garcia is likely landlocked at second base and it's tough to see him playing a multi-positional bench role if he can't play every day, which means he needs to hit a ton to profile.","25tHn1hHWvY","sa3006900"

Nwogu's swing works toward the opposite field gap and he struggles to turn on pitches, but the Cubs have recently been able to adjust some swings (Nico Hoerner is a great example) with similar issues to create more in-game power, which would be a big deal for Nwogu since he has so much of it.",,
