"Jackson Rutledge","WSN","SP","A+",,1,,"45+",2022,"High","22.1777777","6' 8""","245","R","R",2019,"Draft","WSN",3450000,"San Jacinto JC (TX)","After an up-and-down freshman year at Arkansas, Rutledge transferred to Houston-area junior college powerhouse San Jacinto and immediately looked like a first-round pick. He had trouble getting on the mound in Fayetteville in part due to his command, which still isn't great. Rutledge often worked 96-100 at San Jac, mixing in a comfortably-plus slider and a curveball that was closer to average. He would occasionally flash a good changeup, too, but that pitch was a distant fourth offering at the time. That's not really the case anymore, as Rutledge has hit the breaks on his curveball and spent most of 2020 focusing on his changeup, which had good fade and tailing action during spring training this year. 
There's clearly a starter's repertoire here, and potentially that of a very good one, but Rutledge has considerable relief risk because of his command and health history. Some clubs were scared off of his pre-draft medical, which most notably included surgery on his hip. He was a little wild during his 2019 post-draft summer, then spent 2020 behind the curtain of the alt site, and threw just one 2021 big league spring inning. It was a good inning, though. Rutledge beat up the outer half of the plate against all three batters he faced, relying heavily on his fastball, which sat 94-97, and touched 98 once. He also flashed a mid-80s slider twice, fooling the batter both times. He mixed in two changeups (which had fade but did not elicit swings), and his curveball (82) to lesser effect. He erased his only baserunner of the day with a quick pickoff move, catching the runner leaning at first, then made the rest of the batters he faced look uncomfortable and off-balance. 
Will he throw strikes consistently? Well, Rutledge was 6-foot-8 and 260 pounds in the past but looks considerably more svelte now and was listed at 245 this spring. Maybe that will help him better control his body/delivery. He already has a pretty short arm swing, so there's no low-hanging fruit to change there. He belongs in the back of the Top 100 purely on stuff, relief risk included, and is only just outside looking in right now because of short track record of performance and perceived injury risk. <em>(Alternate Site)</em>

In his four 2020 starts, Cavalli was electric, routinely sitting in the mid-90s and touching above, locating a late-breaking, mid-80s slider, and even getting some chases on a hard, sinking changeup. He still spikes too many of those changeups. In his only appearance during 2021 spring training, Cavalli pitched one inning, facing the back half of the Mets’ lineup. He mixed his four-seamer (95-98) and changeup (88-90) for all but one pitch, a sharp, late-breaking 85 mph slider that missed low, but pulled a check swing out of the whiff-resistant Luis Guillorme. Cavalli hasn't pitched a whole lot, so the feel for locating and other minutiae could come later. He has a huge, Adonis-like frame and a huge arm, but he needs to prove he can stay healthy, and his arm action is kind of scary in that regard. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3014421"

Even though he was at the alt site last year, the industry did not have widespread looks at Antuna because the Nationals opted out of alternate site video sharing, per <em>Baseball America</em>. So within the last year, Antuna has only been seen at 2020 instructs and working out (but not playing) with Licey in the Dominican Republic over the winter. It's fair to think the prolonged layoff from real games would make it hard for teams to truly consider him as a Rule 5 selection but Washington added him to their 40-man, just in case. 
Eyeball looks in the fall of 2020 were fair. Antuna has gotten thicker and stronger than before and is now in the bat-first infielder mold, likely to be passable at a combination of second and third rather than be an everyday shortstop. We don't think there's huge physical ceiling here; the cement on the frame here is pretty dry. There are data-driven aspects of Antuna's profile that are hazy because of the lack of performance, but his 2020 fall eyeball report reads like a good role player. This is a switch-hitter who swings with lift and power from the left side of the plate, and has a shorter, contact-driven look with line drive spray toward the gaps from the right side. Antuna will punish you for missing toward the middle of the plate; the rest of the time, he's throwing the bat head at the ball and doing strength-driven damage. He seems able to identify fastball balls and strikes but is apt to swing over breaking balls, and this is where the data performance piece would be more telling and reliable than scattered looks on the backfields. There's risk Antuna is an incomplete offensive player but unless his breaking ball recognition proves to be so bad that he can't hit at all, he projects as the long end of an infield platoon. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa962601"

The high end of his velo band is already creeping into the mid-90s (he was 91-95 during a source's 2020 instructs look), so it's less of a problem that he lacks traditional physical projection. However, it's also possible that Lara becomes more fluid and athletic as he matures, so maybe he'll back into more velocity that way. Eyes on him during arrival to 2021 camp indicate that might be about to happen, as Lara looks a little more lithe. Many other traits typical of top high school pitchers -- the arm action, the glove side fastball/slider command, and the slider quality -- are also promising here, just without the obvious physical projection. Lara has a fantastic pitchability foundation, with an outside shot for his stuff to explode as his body matures. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3014716"

He had a solid pro debut the following summer as a 17-year-old in the GCL in 2019. Scouts described a well-rounded ballplayer without an identifiable weakness: solid average speed, arm strength, a chance to play in center field, and average raw power. Reports coming out of 2020 instructs were similar, if perhaps less enthusiastic about De La Rosa staying in center. A scout source who tends to grade players pretty conservatively said they thought De La Rosa actually has a chance to be a five-tool player. He has strong, quick hands that produce impressive pop for a player this size and age. As a compact-framed, shorter-levered hitter, we have a higher degree of confidence and comfortability betting on De La Rosa's hit tool. He's not a true burner and is a pretty physical kid, so we're projecting an eventual move to a corner, but there's also a real chance the hit/power is enough to profile there. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3011329"

His early pro ball tenure was rocky, too. He was sent away from the team during his first spring training then had a Tommy John surgery later that summer. He returned from surgery to pitch in the 2019 Instructional League and sat 93-95 mph, throwing strikes. 
Romero's changeup had moved ahead of his slider just before he blew out, but his slider is still quite good. Both flashed plus during his three-game 2020 relief debut. His cambio has bat-missing fade while his slider has in- and out-of-zone utility against lefty batters. His velo, mostly 91-93, was down, but 2020's start-and-stop nature might have been at play here, and a fully actualized Romero probably gets back to throwing harder than that. Romero's 2020 season ended when he slipped and broke his right hand using it to try to break his fall. The Nationals put him on the IL and he went to instructs listed as a rehabber. He curiously did not appear in a 2021 spring training game even though he would seem to be high on a rather shallow pitching depth chart, potentially someone who'll take the ball as a spot starter this year. 
His conditioning and injury track record, as well as what the 2020 season did to everyone's innings workload, make it feel more likely that he ends up pitching in relief for the next year or two as he builds back up. There's uncommon upside here, though. Romero has three real weapons coming at hitters from the left side. Toward the back end of his years of team control, he could be a mid-rotation starter. <em>(Alternate site, MLB, Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"21333"

He leaned heavily on his fastball, but also flashed a mid-80s changeup and his trademark overhand curveball, including one with 54 inches of vertical break. By his final spring appearance, he was relying solely on his four-seamer, but he might be able to do that for entire big league outings because it's such a good pitch. Cronin has Greg Holland’s build (scaled up a little bit) and arm slot, which gives him big time carry on that fastball and makes for a traditional power reliever profile when paired with his curve. While at Arkansas, one of Cronin’s teammates would smack him across the face before he entered games. We don’t know if that tradition has continued in pro ball, but as long as he throws strikes and the stuff stays the same, Cronin is a potential high-leverage reliever who could slot into the lineup sooner than later. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3011463"

He was an out-of-control reliever with a head whack so violent that he had trouble keeping his hat on pitch-to-pitch, and his freshman year was shortened by upper arm and elbow injuries, but he still managed an impressive 72 strikeouts and only 18 walks in 58.1 innings pitched. He looked to be continuing that pace before his draft-eligible sophomore season was cut short by the pandemic and Washington popped him 55th overall. At his best, he's regularly into the mid-90s with a plus curveball and solid average changeup along with other starter traits. 
Henry struggled in his one and only inning of 2021 spring work against the Mets. He had trouble throwing his mid-80s changeup for strikes, and only threw one curveball, also for a ball. He attacked the top of the zone with his four-seamer, and the lower half with his sinker, both of which sat 94-96, but didn't miss many bats with either pitch. His outing ended with a 428 foot grand slam on his first pitch to Pete Alonso. There are some fastball playability concerns here, but Henry should be able to bully hitters with velocity in shorter outings. He has a starter’s repertoire but his health track record and the importance of the velocity to his fastball’s playability make him more likely to end up in the bullpen. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em>

His offensive production took a dip that year at least in part because he was playing through a broken finger. Washington invited him to the alt site very late in the summer of 2020 and he finished up at instructs, then got some 2021 spring training reps. Scouts don't think Pineda is a lock to catch because he doesn't have a great arm, but they love his workmanship and makeup, and think he'll find a way to be a viable defender through his competence in the other facets of catching through sheer effort. He projects as a low-OBP hitter with above-average raw power.

His size and style of pitching present a power relief look and the history of arm issues makes it more likely that Cate ends up there than in a rotation. His fastball velocity was only in the low-90s during 2020 instructs, though, and it's been a while since we saw that 92-95 band.

Certainly if you asked us to choose between him and a player exactly like him except 10 months younger, we'd take the younger player, but he frequently squared balls with power during pre-draft looks at him and is likely to stay on the infield dirt, so this feels like a $1 million player to us, too. Infante is a physical hitter likely to move off shortstop (where he played in high school) and to second base due to his middling arm strength.

He still struck out a ton, but also slugged just shy of .600 and walked 23% of the time.

There's real risk that Mendoza's hit tool is just a binary ""no,"" and that he ends up flaming out in Double-A.

But although he was likely among the hardest throwers in the league, command issues dogged his performance, forcing him to pitch from behind in the count often, and limiting his slider usage. During his sophomore year, he seemed to hone his command, which allowed him to better utilize his two-pitch mix, blowing his fastball by batters and fooling them with an above-average, late-breaking slider that played well against both righties and lefties, eventually earning Powell NCAA Stopper of the Year. That summer, he played in the Cape Cod League, and was the closer for Team USA, before returning to UCLA for what would end up being a shortened junior season. But even with his time at the college level coming to such an abrupt end, by the time Powell was selected 94th overall in the 2020 draft, he had already racked up 26 career saves, enough to rank him second in UCLA’s history. 
Chosen despite (or perhaps because of) the fact that he is only projected as a reliever, the 6-foot righty may not be as physically imposing as some of the other behemoths in the Nationals’ system, but the negative impact on his command caused by his long arm action may be negated by its deception, making for an uncomfortable in-the-box experience for batters. His fastball now consistently sits in the mid-90s and touches 97 (up from 92-94 in 2019), and if he can continue to work through any lingering command issues to optimize both of his offerings, he could find himself on Washington’s big league roster very quickly. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em>
