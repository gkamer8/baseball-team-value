"Carter Kieboom","WSN","SS","MLB",21,1,,"60",2020,,"22.8638888","6' 2""","190","R","R",2016,"Draft","WSN",2000000,"Walton HS (GA)","If you've enjoyed watching Keston Hiura hit for the last year or so, you'll enjoy Kieboom, whose hands work similarly in the box. The efficient loop they create as they accelerate through the hitting zone enables Kieboom to hook and lift stuff on the inner half, including breaking balls, and he's especially adept at driving stuff away from him out to right. This is a special hitting talent who has performed up through Triple-A as a college-aged shortstop, and Anthony Rendon's departure opens the door for at-bats right away. 
We don't really like Kieboom at shortstop. He's a little heavy-footed and his hands are below average. He's arguably better-suited for second or third base, but one could argue he's at least as good as Trea Turner is there right now (Kieboom has worse range but can make more throws), so the short- and long-term fit here may be different. Regardless of the defensive home, Kieboom projects as a middle of the order bat with All-Star talent.","_-90cLZAZz4","19958"
"Luis Garcia","WSN","2B",,93,2,,"50",2021,,"20.1611111","6' 0""","180","L","R",2016,"J2","WSN",1300000,"Dominican Republic","Garcia didn't have a great statistical 2019, but he was a teenager at Double-A so we're not weighing that heavily. We care most about Garcia's ability to hit, and that remains strong. His swing and feel for contact are both very similar to Juan Soto's, though of course Garcia lacks that kind of raw thump or plate discipline. Garcia's a proactive swinger but so far his advanced feel for the barrel has allowed it to work. Most of his extra-base damage is going to come via doubles slashed down the left field line and to the opposite field gap, but there's a 20 home run ceiling here if he learns to attack the right pitches. 
A little thicker and slower than most shortstops, Garcia's hands and actions are good and he's probably a better fit at second base. We have him projected as an average everyday player there.","BfeoG30xXmo","sa962605"
"Jackson Rutledge","WSN","RHP",,,3,,"45",2022,,"21.2861111","6' 8""","260","R","R",2019,"Draft","WSN",3450000,"San Jacinto JC (TX)","After an up-and-down freshman year at Arkansas, Rutledge transferred to Houston-area junior college powerhouse San Jacinto and immediately looked like a first-round pick, even before the season started. He had trouble getting on the mound in Fayetteville in part due to his command, which still isn't great, but he has more than enough feel to throw his high-octane stuff over the plate and most lower level hitters can't handle it. Rutledge is a physical monster at 6-foot-8 and 260 pounds, and has an arm swing familiar to those who saw Lucas Giolito's arm action adjustment, typically en vogue with the weighted ball community. 
Rutledge has some of the best stuff on Earth, working 96--100 in most outings and mixing in a 65- or 70-grade slider with a curveball a notch below that. His changeup flashes average but is clearly a fourth option, and his command flashes average at times, but should always be somewhat of an issue given his size. Refining the command to be good enough to let his stuff work over long outings is the main development issue here, but it's worth noting that some clubs were scared off of Rutledge's medical in the draft, which most notably included surgery on both hips. This could go down the ""no one can throw that hard, be that big, and be a healthy 200-inning starter"" road, and see Rutledge become a potential closer, or the ""how did anyone pass on this offensive lineman with Syndergaard's stuff"" path, and get immediate whoopsies from the industry, much like Nate Pearson has so far. Regardless, he'll be fun to watch.",,"sa3011338"
"Cade Cavalli","WSN","RHP",,,4,,"45",2023,,"21.8111111","6' 4""","225","R","R",2020,"Draft","WSN",,"Oklahoma","A chiseled 6-foot-4, 225, Cavalli has a relatively short track record compared to other college pitchers because he was mostly a hitter as a freshman (he was coming off a back injury that kept him from pitching as a high school senior), missed time as a sophomore with a stress reaction, and had his junior season washed by the pandemic. In his four 2020 starts Cavalli was electric, routinely sitting in the mid-90s and touching above, locating a late-breaking, mid-80s slider, and even getting some chases on a hard, sinking changeup. He still spikes too many of those changeups but, again, Cavalli hasn't pitched a whole lot so the cambio and other minutae could come later. ",,
"Wil Crowe","WSN","RHP",,,5,,"45",2020,,"25.8472222","6' 2""","240","R","R",2017,"Draft","WSN",946500,"South Carolina","There are some long-term health questions with Crowe -- his market was diluted by knee and elbow concerns coming out of high school, he's a bigger-bodied guy, and he blew out about halfway through his sophomore year at South Carolina -- but he's ready for a big league rotation right now. Crowe has above-average stuff, his fastball and pair of breaking balls are all capable of missing bats, and we've seen good changeups from him, too. He has imprecise control of everything, and instead just tries to bully hitters with a pretty even mix of the repertoire in competitive locations. He resembles Tanner Roark in many ways and projects to be a starter of similar quality, probably beginning at some point next year.","2bHk9XJKfn4","sa738488"
"Mason Denaburg","WSN","RHP","R",,6,,"45",2023,,"20.9333333","6' 3""","190","R","R",2018,"Draft","WSN",3000000,"Merritt Island HS (FL)","Denaburg had a loud spring as a high school senior, when he went pitch-for-pitch with Carter Stewart in two showdowns and both became first-round picks. Each has had his troubles since then. Denaburg's pro debut didn't happen after signing last summer, as the biceps tendonitis that dinged his draft stock flared up again after signing. In 2019, it looked like he would get to Low-A at some point, but his velocity ticked down and the Nationals held him back in extended ball. Once he built back up (92-94, touching 95 mph) he was set to go to short-season and then Low-A to finish the year. But then he felt something in his shoulder, which led to him being shut down again and never leaving Florida. 
At his best, Denaburg would sit 93-95, hit 98 mph, mix in a consistently 60- or 65-grade curveball and an emerging 55-grade changeup with the size and athleticism scouts can project near the front of a rotation. After two years of inconsistent health, expectations are lower, but between Denaburg, Rutledge, and Romero, there is some pretty goofy stuff bouncing around this system; it'll be exciting if one of them fully puts it together in 2020.","UE-e6imiR6U","sa3010648"

He already sits 92-94, so it's less of a problem that he lacks traditional physical projection. However, it's also feasible that Lara becomes more fluid and athletic as he matures, so maybe he'll back into more velocity that way. Many other traits typical of top high school pitchers -- arm action, glove side fastball/slider command, and the slider quality -- are also promising here, just without obvious physical projection.",," "

He also has a power, overhand curveball that's already consistently plus. While at Arkansas, one of Cronin's teammates would smack him across the face before he entered games. We don't know if that tradition has continued in pro ball, but as long as he throws strikes and the stuff stays the same, Cronin is a potential high-leverage reliever.",,"sa3011463"

He turned down some money out of high school as an out-of-control projected reliever with head violence to where he had trouble keeping his hat on pitch-to-pitch. He's now got a real chance to turn into a mid-rotation starter, but was shut down with arm discomfort late last spring and his velocity still varies. At his best, he's regularly into the mid-90's with a plus curveball and solid average changeup along with other starter traits.",,

Cate was first seen by most scouts in relief for two summers for College Team USA but was always a starter for UConn. His 92-95 mph heater in relief was more 88-92 mph in the rotation and he had forearm tightness early in his draft spring, along with a Tommy John surgery in high school. We mention that amateur background because it's still the conversation around Cate. The Nats hope he's still a league-average starter and think some added weight may increase his stamina. But plenty of evaluators just want to see Cate in the role where he's stood out most (and arguably the role where his arm injuries suggest he belongs), working an inning or two at a time in relief.","KDXLnErxMEQ","sa3007926"

Nationals officials are cautiously optimistic in their accounts of how Romero has been lately, saying his on- and off-field behavior is improving and his physical condition (not always the best) is in a good spot. He returned from surgery to pitch in the instructional league and sat 93-95 mph, throwing strikes. His changeup had moved ahead of his slider just before he blew out and sliders often are the last pitch to come back after surgery, so a fastball-changeup combo will be the main weapons for Romero as he returns on a pitch and innings count. 
Due to the innings limitation as he builds back up, there's a shot that Romero could be fast-tracked in the bullpen if he stays healthy, out of trouble, and in line with his considerable talent. There are some similarities between Romero and Red Sox left-hander Jay Groome: While they've both been dogged by makeup issues and TJ surgery, everything seems to be trending the right direction now. Both are 40 FVs at the moment but could be 50s by the end of the year if everything comes together.",,"sa3005301"

Mendoza has massive raw power and a borderline passive late-count approach, which leads to a healthy heaping of true three outcomes. Along with the patient approach, scouts either complain or simply point out Mendoza's on-field demeanor, which runs from ""low blood pressure"" to ""disinterested."" He looked less like a third baseman over time at Florida State, and the Nationals plan to play Mendoza at first base most of the time going forward. There's still some projection left: Mendoza could have 70 raw power with a high on-base percentage when he gets to the big leagues, but the margin for error is low and could lead to a platoon role.",,"sa3011256"

He looked a little thicker during instructs, and it's more likely that he ends up at third base now, but the rest of the profile is the same: He's still a switch-hitting middle infielder with a pretty, low-ball swing and a frame that might yield considerable raw power. He's age-appropriate for the Penn League (and starting him in Extended seems smart) but he might skip ahead to full-season ball next spring. ",,"sa962601"
