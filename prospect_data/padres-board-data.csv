I thought it was an irresponsible comp when I first heard it, but Abrams does kind of swing like, and generally remind one of, Kenny Lofton. The way Abrams' bat traverses the zone and the way his head kicks back like the butt of a shotgun when he really lays into a ball are both evocative of Lofton, as is Abrams' speed. 
But my main takeaway from the 2020 fall look was how much better of an infielder I thought Abrams had become. Over the last decade or so, infielders who have tended to be on the middle infield/center field line due to poor arm strength or utility (Billy Hamilton, Roman Quinn) have trended to the outfield, so I had been projecting Abrams there. Now I think he can make enough of the throws to play second base, though I also think it makes sense for the Padres to give him reps in center for the sake of versatility, and they might want to do it soon because Abrams' bat is coming quickly. The .401/.442/.662 line he posted throughout the summer after he was drafted isn't sustainable -- players who run as well as he does are a nightmare for rookie-ball infields and Abrams posted a .425 BABIP -- but Abrams can absolutely rake. His gaze appears to be laser-guided as he tracks pitches deep into the hitting zone, he has a knack for impacting the baseball in a way that creates hard contact even though his swing is currently pretty flat, and he can do so all over the strike zone. 
Of the trio of elite middle infield prospects who still aren't yet old enough to drink (Abrams, Bobby Witt, and Marco Luciano), Abrams has the most polished hit tool and the most room left on his frame. Even without a swing change, he's going to grow into more power through physical maturity, which is pretty scary considering his exit velos were already above the big league average in 2019 (though, again, AZL pitching wasn't good that year). This is the best leadoff-hitting prospect in baseball. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>","UhCOxi0kL08","sa3010152"
"MacKenzie Gore","SDP","SP","AAA",23,2,"&darr;","60",2021,"Med","22.2805555","6' 3""","197","L","L",2017,"Draft","SDP",6700000,"Whiteville HS (NC)","The 2020 Padres needed pitching, and it was thought entering spring training that San Diego would not hesitate to promote either Gore or Luis Patiño if they pitched well enough in the minors. Patiño got the call, as (eventually) did Ryan Weathers, but even when their staff was decimated by injury and were throwing bullpen game after bullpen game in the playoffs, Gore did not. Because the Padres' taxi squad trained at the University of San Diego (where there's no TrackMan unit) and the team did not opt-in to alternate site video sharing, other clubs do not have a real idea of how Gore looked there. The Padres acknowledge he was struggling to synch his mechanics, which seems feasible given their complexity. 
After 2020, Gore has now had bizarre issues in two of the last three seasons (he dealt with blisters throughout 2018), but sandwiched between them was one of the most dominant minor league seasons of the last several years, during which Gore was in the top five in minor league ERA, Swinging Strike Rate and Strikeout-to-Walk Ratio among pitchers who threw at least 100 innings. He made 15 starts in the Cal League and surrendered just nine runs. <em>In the Cal League.</em> Aside from the way his fastball plays (it averaged 93 in 2019, has carry and cut, and generated a 17% swinging strike rate, 16% overall), this is not a power pitcher. Gore has typically been athletic enough to maintain his very deceptive, intricate mechanics and execute his bevy of secondary pitches with consistency. His changeup has bat-missing action when it's located, his curveball and slider rely on deception and location to miss bats; neither of them is plus in a vacuum. 
When Gore is pitching his best, he's locating his secondary stuff where he wants. That has not been the case for a while now, including during my couple of looks at Gore during big league spring training and some of my scouting sources' looks at him in Arizona at the Padres' alt site before he broke camp to go to El Paso. I took a laissez faire approach to ranking Gore on the offseason Top 100 because it seemed plausible to me that the bizarre nature of 2020 was at the root of his turbulence, but now we're a couple months into the 2021 season (from a scouting standpoint) and his issues persist. What happened here and how does it get solved? Gore does look thicker and more physical than before; maybe a loss of flexibility, or touch and feel for release, has come with that, which is resulting in worse command. It's not as if Gore has turned into Brady Quinn; his physical development is consistent with typical player aging and maturation. It's equally as likely that this is just another example of the risk and randomness that befalls high school pitching prospects, or that we've just been wrong about Gore. If I'm looking for traits that will get a player through a rough patch like this, it's their athleticism and (insert makeup trait you like most here). I think Gore has those things and will still be a mid-rotation starter in time. He slides on the overall list near Asa Lacy and Tarik Skubal, both lefties with their own strike-throwing problems/question marks. Gore doesn't have to be added to the 40-man until this offseason and so long as his command remains an issue, I don't expect the Padres to use a 2021 roster spot on him unless they have a catastrophic string of injuries, which is obviously possible. <em>(Alternate site)</em>","7bZP4Vs1QhA","sa3005068"

He showed above-average power, some bat control, and improved agility behind the plate, boosting his stock to the late first/early second round of the draft. He didn't catch much velocity in high school and struggled receiving pro arms at first, but that has improved to an acceptable place. More importantly, he's continued to hit. Though his 2019 High-A statline was aided by the Cal League's hitting environment, Campusano's 11% strikeout rate was the second best rate among qualified, full-season backstops in 2019 (Yohel Pozo was first) and his exit velos (89 mph on average) were great for a 20-year-old. He is rumored to have been the centerpiece of San Diego's negotiations with Boston for Mookie Betts and while young catching has a tendency to take a beating and fall short of expectations on offense because of it, right now Campusano looks like a potential star offensive catcher. The Padres' upper-level catching turnover and a spring 2021 injury to Austin Nola foisted Campusano into a situation for which he wasn't ready, but it has had no impact on my long-term opinion of him, which is that he has All-Star offensive ability at the position. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>","7iiD2O17Woo","22217"

He took bigger hacks during the 2020 KBO season and hit more homers without impacting his contact rates, as he also had more walks than K's, a paltry 10% strikeout rate, and an overall line of .396/.397/.523. The ZiPS projections conducted by our own Dan Szymborski this winter loved Kim so much that, purely based on those forecasts, he was one of the top free agents available last offseason. But, of course, there was no way of knowing whether or not Kim would be able to make the leap from the quality of pitching he saw in the KBO to the ungodly stuff coming out of the hands of big league arms. 
The Padres made a four-year bet on him (with a fifth year mutual option) with the notion that he'd be a superutility man. His defensive hands and actions are sufficient for shortstop though not great, but he has the speed and athleticism to play anywhere and make a lot of high-effort plays. He saw time all over the infield and outfield during the spring but has only been 2B/SS/3B so far during the big league regular season. Kim has struggled to adjust to big league stuff early on; 88 mph heaters are still in syndication in Korea. Kim only saw 16 fastballs over 95 mph during his final year with Kiwoom, but had already seen 45 of them by the end of April in the big leagues. He has way more hit tool risk than is typical of a player this age because of the leap and because he's at risk of getting spotty at-bats in a bench role, but even if he ends up with a 40 bat he still has the pull pop to profile as an everyday middle infielder in a vacuum. <em>(KBO)</em>","PHWfaRLrd4U","27506"

It was particularly impressive considering he often pitched on the showcase circuit as well. Somewhat stiff in the lower half, Hassell is not the sort of high-end speedster ideal for center field but his strides eat up space and his first step is pretty good. He looked more comfortable going back on balls last fall than he did as an amateur but closing the deal, especially approaching the wall, can still be an issue as Hassell is apt to lunge for balls late and often catches the ball way out away from his body. Hassell hit with substantially more power during 2020 instructs, then arrived to 2021 spring training (where he got a lot of run with the big league team) with a really steep, uphill swing, and I watched him swing through a lot of fastballs with lateral action during minor league spring training. Hassell's a tempestuous guy and seems to be cut from the same stone-having cloth as Weathers, Gore, and several other guys to whom the Padres have gravitated with their first round picks. I buy that he'll have an everyday hit/power combo eventually, and if he can end up playing center field, he really only needs to have one. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3014701"

This is as gutsy and competitive a young guy as there is in the game, and that's part of why he's totally remade his body and is out there competing at the big league level at age 21 while other kids from his high school graduating class are in college or the mid-minors. But Weathers' stuff has been on a roller coaster for the last couple of years, culminating in the joint inflammation that occurred in a late-April start against Arizona. 
After a dominant beginning to his first full pro season, Weathers' stuff seeped away and he was eventually shut down with a dead arm and missed a chunk of 2019. When he returned, the mid-90s heat from early in the year did not, and Weathers' strikeout rate fell during the dog days of summer. When I saw him later during 2019 instructs, he sat 86-90 for much of his outing, albeit with excellent command, especially of his slider. Last spring, before the pandemic really hit, Weathers was once again living in the mid-90s, and he held that velo for a whole year before he had to leave that aforementioned start against the D-backs with soreness; his fastball was down in the 87-88 mph range. This has happened with Weathers enough that it impacts how I line him up as a prospect despite how quickly he's reached the bigs. There are exceptions, but it's also not typical for a pitcher with a body and delivery like this to stick in a rotation, and while Weathers has surgical slider command, he makes more grip-and-rip use of his fastball and has barely thrown a third pitch as a starter. I'm very confident he'll find a way to make an impact on a pitching staff, but I think he's more likely to end up as a set-up man than a long-term mid-rotation piece. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>","_NYKyhaRURs","23796"

He was 89-93 at Area Code Games the summer after his junior year, then up to 95 in the fall, then came out throwing even harder during his draft spring. He had added considerable muscle and had some spring 2020 starts where he was sitting in the upper-90s, but at least one other where he was only 91-96. Which teams liked him depended on which start they saw, and how data-driven their pitch evaluations are. As some teams pivot toward drafting pitchers with good command of good secondaries and try to develop velocity, Lange is a bit of the opposite. The Padres gave him $2 million in the comp round. He presents the Padres dev team with an elite frame, arm strength, and athleticism. The rest they'll need to develop, as all of Lange's secondaries are relatively raw. His fastball tilt isn't ideal but I think the velo and angle created by his drop-and-drive delivery will mitigate that; it's breaking ball depth that might be an issue from this slot. Regardless, Lange is a high-variance, high-upside talent. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3014517"

He's funky, deceptive, and his changeup has obvious bat-missing ability, while it takes multiple viewings to really appreciate how his fastball and slider play. Knehr (people within the org pronounce it like Greg Kinnear's last name, not like the hair removal product) only sits 91-95 but his fastball has a lot of tailing action. It rides in on the hands of righties and moves enough to induce the occasional chase from lefty batters, though the changeup is more often Knehr's putaway pitch. He's struggled to get his slider to his glove side in my looks but even when that pitch backs up on him, it can freeze righty hitters, who have noted his fastball tail and think they're about to get plunked, by diving into the zone for called strikes. His arm angle and deception helps the slider play against righties, too. I think the odd look Knehr presents is part of what makes him successful and that trait might loose impact if he's seen over and over again as a starter, so I have him in as a multi-inning reliever. There are teams who think he can start and value him more like a 45. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3006952"

I was at what was, to this point, Espinoza's last outing as a top prospect. It was his final spring training start of 2017, when he sat 94-97 and flashed a plus changeup and curveball during the course of a few breezy innings while a handful of scouts and Espinoza's parents watched. Between that outing and his first regular season start for High-A Lake Elsinore, he felt discomfort in his elbow and was shut down. After several weeks of rest and rehab, it was decided that he needed Tommy John surgery, which he had early in August. The timing wasn't great, and Espinoza missed all of 2018 working back from surgery, then re-tore his elbow during the spring of '19 and needed a second TJ; you know the rest. 
In his lone big league outing this spring, he sat 93-95 with very little feel to pitch, and the TV gun had him up to 97 in his first outing at Fort Wayne. Espinoza's delivery has changed a little bit. His stride is a little longer and slightly more open than before. Just from comparing video from 2016 and now, his hips are a little more square to the plate on release and his arm slot is a bit higher, though that could be the camera angles playing tricks on me. Hopefully this aids in his command and fastball playability (if there's indeed a new slot). At peak prospectdom, Espinoza had All-Star stuff with command-driven relief risk. What he ends up becoming after nearly five years without an affiliated inning will be impacted by a) workload constraints and b) roster flexibility. I think he has a chance to start long-term because he's still just 23 and has the talent to generate swing-and-miss action on a couple different pitches. Plus, I 'm betting on the Padres being granted an extra option year for Espinoza due to injury hardship, which gives him a little longer of a runway to rebuild an innings count and shake off whatever rust has accumulated since he last pitched consistently. I want to value Espinoza in an impact FV tier because of his pedigree and because some the dev context surrounding him is favorable. <em>(Alternate site)</em>","LMN6OIaQsEA","sa872856"

His barrel drags through the zone from the left side, making it hard for him to turn on pitches and causing him to pepper the opposite field; his righty swing is more generic. But he gets the bat to the ball from both sides and, though small, is a pretty dynamic athlete who might grow into some pop the way D-backs shortstop Geraldo Perdomo has.

Even though he's only 21, Marcano is so rail thin that I don't think he's going to add meaningful weight and strength. You could argue this is a low-variance 45 sort of profile, but I don't think Marcano is so good at shortstop that that's the case. One-note offensive players like Freddy Galvis and José Iglesias, classic 45s, are each both comfortably better defenders than Marcano. His defensive footwork is great, but his hands and actions are just okay. I'm cautious about over-grading Marcano just because he's so advanced.

He filled out, began throwing harder, added power to a curveball that has ticked up nearly 10 mph since he was an amateur, and stayed healthy until May of 2019 when he was shut down and given a PRP injection in his elbow. He made a few Fall League appearances during which he looked fine, sitting 93-96 with the usual above-average curveball and sinking, mid-80s changeup. Then last spring, after a big league camp outing against the Cubs, Lawson was shut down again and eventually opted for Tommy John surgery in late-March.

Thompson sat 96-99 last fall, and his slider was consistently plus.

His fastball featured natural cut initially, but it has quickly morphed into a pitch with sink and tail. It can miss bats when it's located to his glove side but isn't a dominant, in-zone offering; instead it generates groundballs. Guerra's slider is similarly dependent on precise command, which he doesn't have just yet. The best converted pitchers tend to ascend pretty quickly, and Guerra's now a couple years into his transition, beyond the usual two-year timeline of Jansen, Motte, and other late-inning types. Maybe I should be allowing for a longer timeline for him to really pop because Guerra's fastball shape was overhauled, and this version of him is still relatively new. The Padres are also walking a roster tightrope here. Guerra is out of options. When he comes off the 60-day IL this year, he'll need to rehab and be ready to help a pennant-chasing big league club right away, without the security blanket of an option if things aren't going well.

He hit well in the 2019 DSL (his traditional stats are supported by the TrackMan data sourced from that year) and forced the Padres to push him to full-season ball with a great 2021 minor league spring training performance with the bat. He's now an 18-year-old in full-season ball playing in the ballparks that constituted the old Cal League. He could make a lot of contact, have his power output inflated by the offensive environment, and look like a stud on paper. I saw Angeles twice during the spring but he's not the kind of guy who jumps out at you with big power or speed on a short look; he's a vanilla athlete with very advanced feel for the bat.

Crismatt is so loose and athletic that I think there's a chance he ends up throwing harder as his career progresses.

He has fantastic feel for contact and has only struck out at a 14% career clip while playing both middle infield spots at an acceptable level. His bat control is undercut by a free-swinging approach. Castillo is one of those guys who can make contact with most pitches and so he chooses to swing at most of them, which causes him to chase and put mediocre contact into play.
