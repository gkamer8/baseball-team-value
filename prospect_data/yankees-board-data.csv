"Deivi Garcia","NYY","RHP",,43,1,,"55",2020,,"21.1527777","5' 10""","163","R","R",2015,"J2","NYY",200000,"Dominican Republic","There are workload worries surrounding Garcia because he's 5-foot-9, 165 pounds, and, more relevantly, saw his walk rates spike last year. But one could argue there's a selection bias for height in the pitching population, perhaps one that'll melt away as we keep learning about approach angle, and, because part of the formula for torque (which could theoretically be used as a measure of stress on the elbow) is the distance from the fulcrum, that longer-armed, usually taller pitchers might actually be more of an injury risk than a little guy like Deivi. It's unusual to project heavily on the command of a Triple-A pitcher but it isn't strange to do so on that of a 20-year-old, so even if there are some growing pains related to Garcia's fastball command it's good to remember he's the age of most college pitchers in this year's draft. 
Garcia has big stuff. He works 91-95, mostly at the top of the zone when he's locating, and backs up that pitch with a knee-buckling, old school 12-to-6 curveball that has big depth and bite. He sells his changeup by mimicking his fastball's arm speed but doesn't create great movement on that pitch right now. A better third offering during the early part of his career will probably be his mid-80s slider, though that will be more dependent on command to play. It's possible for a starter to be a 55 when they only throw 120 or fewer innings (Brandon Woodruff and Blake Snell did it last year) but it's much easier if you inch closer to 140. We may find out about Garcia's ability to do that in 2020 if the Yankees increase his innings as they have the last two years, or the big club may need to stick him in a lower-volume role immediately.","TtDspHp7TRI","sa916944"

One director told me Dominguez is impossible to evaluate for a list like this, while a former GM told me he was too low. The Yankees spent almost all but $300k of their initial $5.4 million international pool on Dominguez. He is a hyper-sculpted, switch-hitting athlete who could fit at a number of defensive positions, probably either second base or center field. He has plus tools across the board, including power from both sides of the plate. Dominguez has also largely been seen in workouts and not against live, high-quality pitching, so we don't know much about his feel to hit, but the swing elements are there. There's perhaps some Mike Mamula risk here, and Dominguez is physically mature for a recent J2, but I don't know of another 16-year-old on the planet with tools this loud, and struggle to think of a historical example.","x6cbWcITk7Q",

He ran a 6.4 60-yard dash, had electric infield actions and a plus arm, as well as surprising ability to hit despite his stature, at the time weighing just 143 pounds. He was twitchy, projectable, looked fantastic at shortstop, and was old enough to sign immediately. The Reds were interested but needed Vargas to wait until the following signing period to get the deal done, so the Yankees swooped in with comparable money and got it done sooner. 
Vargas' name was often the first one out of the mouths of scouts who saw New York's talented group in the DSL, and he was one of several the Yankees promoted stateside in the summer. He's a potential impact defender at short who also has uncommon bat control for such a young switch-hitter.","1-63oQOd8s0","sa3008851"

In his first nine starts, he tossed 35 innings, walked 41 batters, and threw 53% of his pitches for strikes. His next five starts included 23 innings, 14 walks, and 57% strikes. His final eight starts were incredible: 45 innings, 63 strikeouts, and just 15 walks. 60% of those pitches were strikes. Mixed into the back half of his season were still some clunky four and five walk outings, so is this trend a sign of things to come or just a blip in a sample too small to trust? 
Medina's stuff is fantastic and has been for a while. He was up to 96 mph as a 15-year-old amateur, eventually going unsigned on July 2nd due in part to his horrendous command. Then he hit 100 mph as an amateur with improved feel, which is when the Yankee scooped him up for $300,000. He still sits 94-98, has hit 101 mph, has a dominant power curveball that's projects as a plus-plus pitch, and his sinking changeup moves enough to miss bats when it's located competitively. The highest walk rates among qualified big league starters are in the 9-11% range, which is where Medina's walk rates were during the second half of 2019. Reds righty Luis Castillo (10%) is a dominant, two-pitch template for Medina's projected ceiling, and unless he once again becomes prone to nuclear strike-throwing meltdowns, his stuff will play in high-leverage relief.","CULpv2BOf-0","sa928510"

He missed a chunk of 2018 with a fractured right hamate then suffered a non-displaced fracture of the right wrist that cost him April and May of 2019. He struggled when he returned, and had an OBP just beneath .300 across 74 Hi-A games, whiffing 33% of the time. It's correct to be weary of Florial because of the strikeouts and injuries -- despite having the physical ability of a top 10 overall prospect, Florial has existed in the 45-50 FV tiers his entire pro career because of the K's -- but it's too early to be dismissive of or fatigued by his stagnant development. He's still just 22 and over the course of 140 games at Hi-A as a 20- and 21-year-old, Florial's .250/.330/.380 line is actually above the Florida State League average. 
And he seems to have done at least some of that while undergoing a swing change. Florial's older swing was stiff-wristed (I'm unsure if it had to do with, or was because of, the injuries) and long, and he was often beaten by fastballs near the top of the strike zone and and swung well inside on soft stuff away from him. His newer swing enables him to get around pitches better and his groundball rate dropped for the second straight season last year. What's more, his minor league spray chart, per Baseball Savant, showed less contact peppering the shortstop area and third base line. His TrackMan data indicates the strength and power were intact coming off of the wrist injury. All of this is evidence that Florial remains a talented work in progress capable of making adjustments, which he clearly needs to continue doing.","mYK2ssfvC80","sa874464"

All are smaller, contact-oriented hitters with good feel for the game and up-the-middle defensive profiles. Now Peraza is a plus shortstop defender with what looks like a future plus hit tool. Plus, he's only 19 and his exit velocities are beginning to climb. There are lots of infielders in this system with a frame similar to Gleyber Torres', stout and strong, and that's the way Peraza is tracking. It limits the raw power projection, but if Peraza's rate of contact holds up, he's going to hit for power by virtue of the quality and amount of contact he's making. He's tracking like a lot of the contact-oriented shortstops currently toward the back of the overall Top 100, and is a potential regular.",,"sa3003305"

Mechanical ease is often an indicator for scouts to project on command/control but there are Neftalí Feliz sorts of exceptions, and I think that's what we've got here. The effortlessness with which Gil generates upper-90s heat is unbelievable, but his release point waivers and he walks guys. 
His presence on the 40-man makes it more likely Gil gets fast-tracked as a reliever, though he should continue starting a) just in case things click, because the ceiling is huge if it does and b) the reps will help sharpen his secondary stuff, which is good but not quite as good as his dominant fastball. There are very few big league pitchers with this combo of velocity and spin and a bunch of them throw cutters. Gil's heater had a 20% swinging strike rate last year and would probably be harder if he were in the bullpen. He's going to have a dominant offering that I think eventually spearheads a high-leverage relief future.",,"sa877821"

A Yankees source credits the velo bump to a foundation laid during Yaure's 2017 Tommy John rehab. Additionally, Yajure's changeup has become a plus pitch. It's a firm, sinking offering in the upper-80s. He works his cutter away from righties for swings and misses, and can dump his curveball in for strikes the second and third time through the order to get ahead of hitters with something new. His huge 60-inning workload increase from 2018 to 2019 was a bit surprising, and assuming Yajure doesn't come out of the chute sitting 88-92 from the aftershocks of that uptick, he's tracking like a 50 FV arm.",,"sa873213"

Volpe will likely be a plus shortstop defender -- his feet, hands, and actions are all plus, his range is average -- and has good feel for contact, but he lacks both strength and the physical projection that enables teams to anticipate strength will come. Keep in mind this is what Peraza's scouting report read like last year, and he appears poised to make so much contact as to render his relatively modest raw power projection irrelevant. That path is the one Volpe could take toward an everyday role, but it's more likely that he ends up a glove-first utility type.","EpQrKumdH-A","sa3010868"

And Abreu's stuff remains incredible -- 94-99 as a starter, 70-grade changeup, two good breaking balls -- but strike-throwing consistency has never materialized here, and he projects as a nasty bullpen piece.

Instead, his offensive development stalled on its own. Most of the physical tools are intact, Cabello's swing just looked out of whack, and he was coming off of a dislocated shoulder that truncated his 2019. His front side was leaking way down the third base line (which happened during his incredible 2018, too), and his swing was described as long to me, which is odd for a hitter this size. 
This is still a rare blend of skills, especially if catching is ever revisited. Cabello still runs well, and last year he inspired one of my favorite scout quotes of all time when I was told that he has a ""grinding gait, full effort, kicking up grass as he runs like the rooster tail of a speed boat."" In addition to potential plus hit and run tools, there's above-average arm strength, and what was billed as above-average raw power that hasn't shown in the exit velos yet. Though Cabello's top end exits are still good for his age, his averages are not good for someone as physically developed as he is, a piece of evidence that supports the visual assessment of his swing. Still, I'm not out after one bad year, and think Cabello has everyday physical ability.",,"sa3005600"

We're not talking about premium arm strength, but Contreras should end up with three quality offerings (intentionally or not, he can vary the shape of his breaking ball enough that he functionally has four) and plenty of strike-throwing ability to start. Barring continued development of his changeup, which already looks better than we projected a year ago, he won't have a plus pitch and therefore fits in the No. 4/5 starter area rather than as a plus, mid-rotation type.","y0x_qpio0cg","sa3003020"

He added mass in his lower half and traded some contact for power, resulting in 29 doubles. It will be interesting to see how Cabrera's new physicality interacts with his defensive fit. He has some of the best defensive hands in the entire org and should at least be a shift-aided multi-positional infielder even if he continues to thicken and slow. 
Cabrera sometimes swings at suboptimal pitches because he can move the bat head around and make contact with pitches all over the place, but this will limit his OBP and power output if it continues.

While he now has 70-grade fastball velocity, his long arm action and three quarters slot create sinking action on the pitch that ends up generating groundballs more than swings and misses. The whiffs are going to come from the changeup, which bottoms out as if a trap door has opened beneath it just as it approaches the plate. At this age, I think the breaking ball refinement necessary to make Vizcaino a starter is unlikely, but I would have said the same thing about his fastball and changeup last year.",,"sa920272"

He still needs a weapon to deal with lefty hitters and to repeat his delivery better, something that should come as his limbs fill out. And Gomez has sort of an odd build. His limbs are skinny but his trunk is not, and his shoulders are rounded and pitched forward. It's perhaps irrelevant because he is already throwing hard, but the build is similar to Jorge Guzman's, whose strike-throwing hasn't materialized.

Then German (Dominican-born and whose name is pronounced like the European country) had one of the latest pre-draft velo spikes possible, suddenly hitting 95 mph during the Atlantic Sun conference tournament in his final college game just two weeks before Day One. Miles per hour are a dime a dozen these days, but German had the athleticism and arm action of a starter and had put on about 15 pounds in the previous 12 months, so some thought this could be coming. Clubs who had scouts at that final start shot him up their boards, and the Yankees jumped to the front of the line to take him in the fourth round. 
The velo spike held throughout German's first summer in pro ball -- he sat 92-95 and touched 97 mph in the fall instructional league, and put on about 10 additional pounds after signing -- and then moved yet another tick last year -- 93-96, touch 98 -- even though German is still starting.
