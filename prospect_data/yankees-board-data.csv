At a certain point in time, the same was true of Kevin Maitan. That is the range of potential outcomes here, as we still only truly know about Dominguez's showcase tools (what it's like to watch him take BP and run, both of which are scintillating) and very little about how he'll perform against pro pitching. Because of how early and how covertly the Yankees and Dominguez agreed to a deal (New York spent all but about $300k of its initial $5.4 million international pool on him), few scouts have seen him at all, and even fewer have seen him against quality live pitching, although that number has started to creep up as he participates in live BPs in the Dominican Republic. The mystery and intrigue, rare for elite, contemporary teenage athletes because of the prevalence of social media video, and those slick Yankees pinstripes have created a fever pitch of expectation for Dominguez in both the real world and the baseball card finance bro space. 
Last year, when Dominguez was close to near the top of the 50 FV tier (where he'll remain), one scouting director told me he is impossible to evaluate for a list like this, while a former GM told me he was too low. It's hard to find switch-hitters with power like this, let alone ones who already have usable swings from both sides of the plate at this age. Dominguez got very jacked in 2020 and looked more like a Mr. Universe competitor than a baseball prospect. Not everyone digs this, and it's discussed with the same tone of captivation and alarm as Zion Williamson's size and explosion. There's no precedent for someone this age being as big and strong as Dominguez already is, but nobody is sure what that means for his long-term athletic viability. I'm probably more comfortable ranking someone like this highly than a GM would be acquiring him for equivalent value, but it's possible that, a year from now, Dominguez will have become unacquirable. He's the highest-variance prospect in baseball, and maybe the highest-variance athlete in sports. <em>(DR Instructional League)</em>","x6cbWcITk7Q","sa3014696"
"Deivi Garcia","NYY","SP","AAA",60,2,,"50",2021,"Med","22.0444444","5' 9""","163","R","R",2015,"J2","NYY",200000,"Dominican Republic","Any WAR-based analysis of pitching (including FV) is influenced by the innings total, and there are still questions about whether Garcia can handle something close to a 180-inning workload because he's only 5-foot-9 and 165 pounds, and the pandemic made it impossible for Garcia, or anyone like him, to answer those questions either way. I think it's fair to wonder simply because Garcia hasn't done it yet, but I'm more inclined to dismiss arguments focused on his size. I wrote last year that, because part of the formula for torque (which could theoretically be used as a measure of stress on the elbow) is the distance from the fulcrum, that longer-armed, usually taller pitchers might actually be more of an injury risk than a little guy like Deivi. But having watched Garcia go about his business at the big league level, I'm backpedaling his FV by a grade, since I think his power-pitcher's approach will make it tough for him to work as efficiently as he'll need to in order to log the aforementioned sort of innings total. 
Marcus Stroman sets great precedent for smaller pitchers like this, but while Garcia is really well-put together and athletic, he's not quite the elite-level on-mound athlete that Stroman is, and Stroman's stuff works in such a way that he gets one or two early-count grounders every inning, while Garcia just doesn't pitch like that. Instead, Garcia's tries to sneak 91-95 past hitters at the top of the zone. The angle and spin axis of his fastball helps it play up, but it isn't a plus pitch. His 12-6 curveball is beautiful, but can be easy to identify out of his hands because of its rainbow shape, so even though it has what I'd consider plus-plus depth, and plus spin, it also plays more in the 50/55 range. Garcia's changeup, which has about 12 mph of velocity separation from his fastball, is likely to become his most effective secondary weapon, and he already has great feel for locating it. His slider's shape is similar to his curveball's, just with more velocity. The entire repertoire is either average or a shade above it, and I think Garcia will end up working around 140 innings and generating 2-ish WAR annually. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>","TtDspHp7TRI","20276"

He added strength to a contact/defense foundation and his exit velocities moved very close to major league average, which was impressive for a 19-year-old. Peraza got some reps early during big league spring training before heading home for the summer. He then played sparingly for Cardenales de Lara in the Venezuelan Winter League. There he showed a modified stance and hand set-up, but he played so little that it's hard to say how it might impact his quality of contact without more looks and/or data to support it. I do think he'd benefit from taking a longer stride, though. Either way, this is a contact-oriented shortstop who'll likely be an above-average defender, maybe better than that. I have conviction in the hit tool due to Peraza's curt, short swing, his visible barrel control and his track record of hitting as a young-for-the-level player so far. He may only ever hit for doubles power but on a good-gloved shortstop, that's an everyday player. <em>(Venezuelan Winter League)</em>",,"sa3003305"

Most teams had multi-million dollar evaluations on Vargas while he was an amateur based on how he looked in workouts. He ran a 6.4 60-yard dash, had electric infield actions and a plus arm, as well as surprising ability to hit despite his stature, at the time weighing just 143 pounds. He was twitchy, projectable, looked fantastic at shortstop, and was old enough to sign immediately. The Reds were interested but needed Vargas to wait until the following signing period to get the deal done, so the Yankees swooped in with comparable money and got it done sooner. 
Vargas' name was often the first one out of the mouths of scouts who saw New York's talented group in the 2019 DSL, and he was one of several the Yankees promoted stateside during that summer. While he doesn't have the strength and physicality of Dominguez, I'm betting on Vargas' athleticism, his ability to rotate with ferocity in the batter's box, and his underlying body composition, and project that he'll eventually have some power. I think he has star-level ceiling but, due to proximity from the big leagues, a lot of risk, too. <em>(DR Instructional League)</em>","1-63oQOd8s0","sa3008851"

In his first nine starts of 2019, he tossed 35 innings, walked 41 batters, and threw 53% of his pitches for strikes. His next five starts included 23 innings, 14 walks, and 57% strikes. His final eight starts were incredible: 45 innings, 63 strikeouts, and just 15 walks. 60% of those pitches were strikes. Mixed into the back half of his season were still some clunky four and five walk outings. Then Medina spent 2020 at the alternate site before the Yankees turned him loose on the Clemente League in Puerto Rico during the winter. He won the league's Pitcher of the Year award, striking out 32 hitters in 16 innings while walking just six. 
Medina's stuff is fantastic and has been for a while. He was up to 96 mph as a 15-year-old amateur, eventually going unsigned on July 2 due in part to his horrendous command. Then he hit 100 mph as an amateur with improved feel, which is when the Yankee scooped him up for $300,000. He still sits 94-98, has hit 101 mph (he was supposedly up to 103 in 2020 but I can't confirm it), has a dominant power curveball that projects as a plus-plus pitch, and his sinking changeup moves enough to miss bats when it's located competitively. He loses mechanical consistency late in outings, but remember that Medina is still just 21, he's super loose and athletic, and held premium stuff throughout a huge inning increase in 2019. There's enough relief risk here that I'd go so far as to say the bullpen is the likely outcome, but Medina is going to have three impact pitches, so his outcome there might be elite. <em>(Alternate site, LigaPR)</em>","I9TaS7pOWgU","sa928510"

For context, Alcantara was fourth on my international list in 2018, and was one of the players the Yankees promoted from the DSL to the GCL in the middle of the summer of 2019. He was part of New York's DR instructs in the Fall. Athletic 6-foot-6 outfielders who can rotate like Alcantara can are rare, and this young man might grow into elite power at maturity. He is loose and fluid in the box but does have some swing-and-miss issues, though it's not because lever length is causing him to be late -- it's more of a barrel accuracy issue right now. This is one of the higher ceiling teenagers in the minors, but of course Alcantara might either take forever to develop or never develop at all. <em>(DR Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3008752"

He looked comfortable in a handful of 2020 big league spring training at-bats before the pandemic, then picked up at-bats in the DR during the Fall. He's a stocky guy who only really fits at second base, and isn't very good there. As he continues to age he'll likely only be able to stay there with the aid of good defensive positioning, and even then Duran's hands need to improve. But boy, does he have power. His long, slow, aggressive leg kick helps him generate big pop, and he can move the bat head around the zone. The titanic hacks he takes create some swing-and-miss but this isn't a guy with a grooved swing, and there's impact bat-to-ball/power interplay going on here. This is a site that tends to avoid prospect comps unless they're flush to the prospect's profile, and Duran's is a dead ringer for Dan Uggla's. <em>(DR Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3005271"

He works with what amounts to four different pitches: a high-spin two-seamer that he works to his arm side, a four-seamer that he locates up and to his glove side, a nasty two-plane breaking ball, and a changeup. It's a slam dunk starter's repertoire in a vacuum, but Schmidt has one of the longer, gnarlier arm actions in baseball and already has one surgery under his belt. He also shows pretty significant release variation depending on pitch type, with his breaking balls coming from a lower, wider point while his fastballs, especially the four-seamer, comes from a vertical one. All of his release points viewed at once look more like a crescent rather than one tight, circular cluster. It's possible hitters will be able to pick up on this, but it's also possible Schmidt hides the ball so well that they won't. It's something we'll just have to learn by watching big leaguers face him.  The confluence of arm action length, release variance and injury history all create substantial relief risk here, but even if Schmidt ends up in a role of that sort, I think his repertoire depth will enable him to either close or work in a valuable multi-inning role. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>",,"19899"

That the Yankees added him to their 40-man even though he wasn't at the alt site and decision-makers in the org had no traditional instructs to see is supporting evidence if you want to infer that they feel this way, too. 
The baseball gods gave Yoendrys Gomez a velo bump, which is like giving an Austrian composer a Les Paul. A year ago, Gomez was being described as a pitchability righty who could effectively vary his fastball's movement. Now he's touching 98. Talk of the fastball cutting and sinking has stopped and Gomez is now taking a power approach, working his fastball at the top of the zone in concert with a curveball at the bottom. He still needs a weapon to deal with lefty hitters and to repeat his delivery better, something that should come as his limbs fill out. And Gomez has sort of an odd build. His limbs are skinny but his trunk is not, and his shoulders are rounded and pitched forward. It's perhaps irrelevant because he is already throwing hard, but the build is similar to Jorge Guzman's, whose strike-throwing hasn't materialized. Last year, Gomez's stuff looked like it projected to be close to average but now he may end up with at least one plus pitch and the curveball has a shot, too. <em>(At-home dev)</em>",,"sa3004650"

Gomez used the layoff to remake his body. He was a thick-in-the-middle 30 runner as an amateur, which is part of why he signed for just $600,000, but he was clearly a good baseball athlete. Instead of timed speed or visible strength, he displayed quick-twitch movement, first step quickness, lateral agility while ball-blocking, and hitting explosion through strength in his forearms, wrists, and hands. Over the summer he reworked his body, and has been working out in Miami with Aaron Judge, and he's now svelter but still plenty strong. A virtual lock to catch, Gomez has soft hands and is mobile behind the plate, and he has impact arm strength. 
While somewhat grooved, his swing is geared for in-game power, which gives him a chance to get to average raw pop. Purely from a talent perspective, Gomez might belong in the 50 FV tier (he's defensively similar to Drew Romo though I feel better about Gomez's bat, if you want to gauge where I think he'd go in a draft), but he's barely played in games and the attrition rate for teenage catching is very high. <em>(At-home dev)</em> ","UIUzPZR_djw","sa3008746"

While he now has 70-grade fastball velocity, his long arm action and three quarters slot create sinking action on the pitch that ends up generating groundballs more than swings and misses. The whiffs are going to come from the changeup, which bottoms out as if a trap door has opened beneath it just as it approaches the plate. At this age, I think the breaking ball refinement necessary to make Vizcaino a starter is unlikely, but I would have said the same thing about his fastball and changeup last year. <em>(Alternate site)</em>",,"sa920272"

At Arizona, where he split catching duties with Mets fourth rounder Matt Dyer, Wells raked. He hit .357/.476/.560 in two years at U of A, and while I'm inclined to discount that line because PAC-12 pitching wasn't very good during that time, he also hit .308/.389/.526 on Cape Cod, where it is. Still a fringy receiver, his arm strength impacted by a previous arm injury, Wells probably can't catch but he is mobile enough to run around in the outfield.

The grace and ease of his delivery belied his control problems, similar to how Neftalí Feliz and Yadier Alvarez both tricked evaluators into projecting heavily on their command. Gil's feel for release is now dialed in enough that he is unlikely to have serious, role-altering walk issues, but not so much that he suddenly projects as a starter. His presence on the 40-man adds to the likelihood that he ends up working in relief and only relief, as does his limited repertoire. His fastball is dominant (it generated a 20% swinging strike rate in 2019) and he can execute a slider to his glove side fairly regularly, but that slider relies on location and is crushable in the zone.  His changeup is still relatively new but isn't great. I think it has more ceiling than the slider just by virtue of the fact that Gil hasn't had as long to work with it.

Keep in mind that this is what Peraza's scouting report read like last year, and he appears poised to make so much contact as to render his relatively modest raw power projection irrelevant.

He has some of the best defensive hands in the entire org and should at least be a shift-aided multi-positional infielder even if he continues to thicken and slow. 
Cabrera sometimes swings at suboptimal pitches because he can move the bat head around and make contact with pitches all over the place, but this will limit his OBP and power output if it continues.

It's ironic that the Yankees didn't want to slow down Cabello's bat development by asking him to catch (he did as an amateur, and his build and arm strength are both visual fits behind the plate). Instead, his offensive development stalled on its own. Most of the physical tools are intact, Cabello's swing just looked out of whack, and he was coming off of a dislocated shoulder that truncated his 2019. His front side was leaking way down the third base line (which happened during his incredible 2018, too), and his swing was described as long to me, which is odd for a hitter this size. 
This is still a rare blend of skills, especially if the catching is ever revisited. Cabello still runs well, and last year he inspired one of my favorite scout quotes of all time when I was told that he has a ""grinding gait, full effort, kicking up grass as he runs like the rooster tail of a speed boat."" In addition to potential plus hit and run tools, there's above-average arm strength, and what was billed as above-average raw power that hasn't shown in the exit velos yet. Though Cabello's top end exits are still good for his age, his averages are not good for someone as physically developed as he is, a piece of evidence that supports the visual assessment of his swing. Still, I'm not out after one bad year, and think Cabello has everyday physical ability. <em>(At-home dev)</em>",,"sa3005600"

Breaux is a very physical hitter with huge raw power, red flag peripherals, and stuff that might prevent him from catching. When he was a two-way JUCO prospect, he was in the upper-90s on the mound. A sore elbow cost him a bunch of 2019 and may also have sapped some of his arm strength, depending on when you saw him. Even a fully operational Breaux has some footwork and exchange issues that can slow his release or impact throwing accuracy.
