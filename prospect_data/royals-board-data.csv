His skillset compares quite closely to Trevor Story's. There are going to be some strikeouts but Witt is a big, athletic specimen who is very likely to not only stay at shortstop but be quite good there. He also has a swing geared for pullside lift (he can bend at the waist to go down and yank balls away from him, too) and the power to hit balls out even when he swings a little flat-footed. He is the son of a former big leaguer and carries himself like one, which has endeared him to scouts and coaches during the course of a high-profile amateur career laden with very high expectations. His debut statline lacked power on the surface, but the batted ball data suggests we shouldn't worry.","t9XYmBesagk","sa3011225"

While his delivery creates some visual relief risk, there is none regarding the pitch mix. Laxy's the slot creates backspin on the fastball that enables it to have big carry at the top of the zone, his slider has remarkable length for how hard it is, and when Lacy gets on top of his curveball it has huge, bat-missing depth. The deilvery also disorients hitters who take lots of bad, awkward swings at pitches that live in the middle of the zone. His changeup (which Lacy sets up with a two-seamer) is occasionally good-looking, and might be a real out pitch if it's re-emphasized in pro ball. ","fKeDYi5Wzzo",

In the month or so leading up to the draft, Lynch's velo ticked up, and down the stretch he sat 92-94, touching 95 mph deep into starts, with an assortment of offspeed pitches that all flashed above-average. The track record of Virginia arms is concerning, but Lynch seemed less beholden to the issues traditionally associated with their prospects, with some scouts considering him endearingly rebellious. 
He throws a cutter, slider, curveball, and changeup that all flash above-average, with the slider occasionally flashing plus. He was 93-95 last year, and while Lynch missed a month and a half with an arm injury last summer, all of that velo and more was back in the fall, so the velo uptick has held for nearly a year now. He's a No. 4  starter.","fYTcfoSuY7w","sa3007588"

He ended up being a great buy-low value pick for Kansas City as not only did the strikes return, but Bubic was throwing a little harder, too. 
He's far more likely to hang around the 50/45 FV membrane during the rest of his time in the minors than he is to move way up the list, because even though my notes have Bubic up to 95 last year, he still lives in the low-90s and succeeds because of deception and his terrific secondary stuff. I prefer his changeup and curveball to the bat-missing weapons of other arms in Kansas City's system (Jackson Kowar has a great change and throws a heavy sinker that doesn't miss bats, while Brady Singer is a sinker/command guy) and think Bubic will be a No. 4.","Yy1pUfroMeg","sa3008128"

Negotiations broke down, one of several times a high school pitcher has been at odds with an org run by current Braves GM Alex Anthopolous, and Singer went to Florida. After an uneven but promising freshman year in the bullpen, Singer's command improved and he carved up SEC lineups for the next two years. 
His stuff and delivery don't have the look of a dominant, whiff-getting major league starter, at least not at the moment. He has a lower, three-quarters delivery that helps create long tail on his two-seamer, but the pitch only resides in the 91-94 mph area, a 45 raw velocity that I think plays a bit better because of the movement. His low-80s slurve/slider (when it's down below hitters' knees it has more length) gets buffed by Singer's command and also plays up above its raw quality. Singer is a spiky competitor who goes right at hitters and at times has demonstrative body language when he's frustrated with umpires, which are generally traits the industry likes. On talent, he's a No. 4/5 type of starter for me, and any change to that will be determined by how Singer's changeup, which he barely used in college, develops in pro ball. The (+) designation on Singer's FV comes from his track record of durability, and his potential to eat a ton of innings and have a higher WAR output than you'd think given his stuff alone.","cdTk2Lmfb70","sa3008613"

Though not as overtly projectable as the Kristian Robinson/Alexander Ramirez sorts, Peña was clearly going to grow into some power and, based on how he hit in games and played center field, was thought to have a strong chance to become a well-rounded player, perhaps a five-tool sort, with all the tools close to average. It was surprising then that Peña arrived for his first fall instructional league looking like an NFL cornerback, with one source going so far as to tell me they think Peña has a big league body right now. 
Even though his swing is a bit clunky, and his footwork is perhaps unnecessarily conservative, Peña looked pretty comfortable against pro pitching in the fall, the best pitching he's ever faced in his life to this point; his performance included him roping a single off of Michael Kopech, who was sitting 97 that day. The surprising physicality has already brought about more power and bat speed, and Peña already has the helicopter overhead finish to his swing à la Miguel Andújar and Wander Franco. Once the industry becomes more confident in grading his defense and bat, which will come once he's faced pro pitching for an extended period of time, he could be a global top 50 prospect based on his place on the defensive spectrum and the hit/power combination.","fYcFn23SsMI",

That was the question put to me about Kowar by a source for this list. On some level, they're right. Like Paddack, Kowar has a prototypical frame, he throws in the mid-90s, and has a dominant changeup. What we now know about how and why fastballs play, however, creates some separation between the two. Though Kowar has premium starter fastball velocity, the pitch has tailing/sinking action rather than Paddack-style carry and ride, which means it's going to generate groundballs more than it will miss bats. 
Kowar's breaking ball was comfortably below average in college but the Royals have found a way to add raw spin since acquiring him (his rates are up from 2150 rpm to 2400, still shy of big league average but an encouraging development), and it's closer to average now. He'll likely rely on the element of surprise and his ability to locate it in order to be effective. This is all very similar to how Luke Weaver's reports read coming out of Florida State, and I expect Kowar to have a similar career. He's a 23-year-old who's thrown half a season above A-ball, so while I think he'll be a 50 FV eventually, there needs to be a little gap between him and someone like him who's ready for the big leagues right now.","6Gnu6dq3LLQ","sa3008273"
"Kyle Isbel","KCR","LF",,,8,,"45+",2022,,"23.3638888","5' 11""","183","L","R",2018,"Draft","KCR",592300,"UNLV","You should feel free to toss out Isbel's 2019 regular season statistical performance. After a red hot first few weeks of the season -- .348/.423/.630 -- he pulled a hamstring, and shortly after he returned to game action in Extended, he broke his hamate and was shelved again until mid-July. As is typical for hitters coming back from that injury, Isbel's numbers were poor -- .216/.282/.361 overall at Wilmington -- and improved the further away from surgery he got, culminating in a strong back half of August and Fall League; his Fall League look especially assuaged concerns. 
Isbel has a compact swing (he's a shorter-levered guy) with line drive plane. It's geared to do most of its big damage to his pull side, but he can slice extra-base contact down the left field line and into the left-center field gap. Isbel is still relatively new to playing the outfield full-time, which gives him some late projection on the defensive end. I think he'll be easily supplanted by a superior defensive center fielder but will be a plus corner defender long-term, and I'm intrigued by the idea of him playing a situational second base since he has some experience there, too. He projects as an average everyday corner outfielder.","uDxxZ8QvMhY","sa3006861"

He has the tools of a three-true-outcomes right fielder, potentially one who plays above-average defense, but the quality of his at-bats against elite competition has been mixed, at best. It's likely going to take a swing adjustment to get Lee hitting for relevant power in games. His swing is long, and on pitches he impacts toward the top of the zone, it cuts downward. This causes Lee to be late on good velocity and drive a lot of pitches into the ground. He's still young enough to make these and other adjustments, but I have Lee projected as the larger half of a right field platoon rather than a true everyday player.","55IWf1Fbris","sa917996"

His timing and actions around as the pivot man on doubles plays is excellent and he has plenty of arm for the left side of the infield. Offensively, Loftin will hit the occasional pull-side tank that makes you think he has big power, but he really only has it to that dead pull side. He'll concede some power in order to poke and serve balls the other way but he's much less likely to do damage that way, and he may be someone opposing teams can pitch to in pro ball. Loftin went bonkers at a big college tounrmanet in Houston just before the shutdown, and his name was mentioned as high as the middle of round one, probably for an underslot deal. By late during the first night of the draft rumors were circulating that a team in the comp round was trying to float Loftin back to them with an overslot deal (I'm not sure if it was KC) and that most teams toward the back of round one had to weigh taking him despite this, and daring him not to take slot.",,

This is a lefty with power relief stuff, at least, and a chance to start based on the depth of his pitch mix and the rate of strikes he's thrown so far. I think Cox's fastball would tick up into the mid-90s if he were ever put in the bullpen, which at this rate only seems likely to happen if his breaking balls end up running together, something Cox has worked to mitigate as a pro. He held his velocity last year despite a 20-inning workload increase, his results were not diluted even after he was moved to Hi-A for the back half of last year, and in just two years, he's gone from a Day Three pick to someone who has the FV of a typical second rounder. Whether Cox ends up pitching toward the back of a rotation or as some kind of fire-breathing, multi-inning reliever (that's where I've got him, and his future value grade reflects that), he's a huge coup for Kansas City's amateur department and player dev program.",,"sa3007777"

Chief among them was Melendez, who was on initial drafts of our top 100 last year before Kiley and my team sources squashed that with their feedback, citing Melendez's red flag contact issues. They were right. Melendez struck out a damning 40% of the time last year. His swing is geared for low ball contact at a point in time when pitchers are attacking hitters at the top of the zone more than ever, and Melendez gets heat blown past him at the letters constantly. 
Everything else that scouts loved about him as an amateur is still extant. He has plus raw power, great long-term body projection, a plus arm, and projects to have a 55 glove, which is beneath the 60 or 70 grades he was garnering in high school but is still a relevant positive. We're now looking at a likely backup catcher based on how scary the contact issues are, but if the swing issues are fixed, Melendez could really break out because the physical tools that the swing compromises are rare for the position. There are teams/scouts for which Melendez, Pratto, and Matias are just a ""no"" based on the way they've performed with the bat. I'm holding out varying degrees of hope for them, still preferring Melendez because his defense gives him a fallback big league role even if the hit tool never develops enough for him to be a regular.","jMI-XsZIgSA","sa3004139"

Hernandez has had premium velocity since he signed, but has averaged just five innings per start and 67 innings per season since 2017. Two of the three times Hernandez has missed time have been due to issues unrelated to his arm, so injuries themselves are not a concern for me so much as I'm skeptical that he can live in the mid-90s over a full season starter's workload. 
He doesn't have a cut, athletic physique, and his delivery is reliever-y and somewhat stiff, but Hernandez does repeat, and throws a lot of strikes. His breaking ball has vertical action that enables it to outperform its raw spin rate but it is reliant on his command, which again, during the fall Hernandez had. I've seen backfield outings during which I thought his changeup was his best secondary but that's not typically the case. It's possible he can start, but I don't consider it likely, and Hernandez certainly hasn't proven it yet. If that's the case, then one of the secondary pitches needs to develop still, which all the missed time has made harder.",,"sa3004199"

But Matias' physicality and bat speed are so supreme, the gap between his talent and that of most players so obvious, that there's a chance he can be one of the exceptions, even if it’s in a streaky, inconsistent manner. 
As a teen, Seuly was already posting exit velocities on par with burly, Quad-A type hitters. Most of the issues he has are mental; his swing decisions and defensive instincts are both poor. My sources tend to be pessimistic about improvements/corrections to approach and aptitude, though perhaps that's because they can't see those things with their eyes, the tool they use most often and confidently to do the majority of their job. Many of the players ranked beneath Seuly here have a better chance than he does of playing some kind of big league role, but none of them have his ceiling, and based on his age, frame, and athleticism, I'm holding out some hope that he shows us what it is for a few years.","nilomZgO1c4","sa917039"

His arm is so fast as to almost look subliminal, and Zuber's command of both breaking balls is much better than one expects from a college relief prospect. His changeup usage has been inconsistent over the last two years but at times it's a quality pitch, and one Zuber seemed to be rebooting during the spring with some success.

In part because he was old for his graduating class, and also because there were concerns about his ability to make contact, teams didn't meet McConnell's high school asking price and he ended up at Florida. That's exactly the sort of place players like him can go to reinforce confidence in their bat, but McConnell barely played as a freshman and was old enough to be draft eligible as a sophomore, and so by draft time there was relatively little data to fight the skepticism concerning his. 
But he's also got above-average raw power, plus speed, and can play shortstop (he was listed as an outfielder on the instructs roster but did not play), so he can still be a valuable player even if the bat falls short of average and his ceiling is sizable if it gets better than that. If you've read the list in order before arriving at McConnell's blurb, you know this org has had trouble with players who have swing-and-miss issues upon their arrival in the system.

He's not physically projectable, but he's athletic and has some traits typical of sinker/changeup-centric rotation pieces, and his breaking ball spin rates indicate he may have an average breaker one day, too.

All of that has been in A-ball, save for the 2019 Fall League, during which Hicklen struggled.

The A's toyed with a cutter for Aquino at one point but scrapped that a month or two before he was traded; it seems like the Royals brought it back after they acquired him, as the pitch went from the slidery low-80s into the 85-88 mph range.","FvJi-WgUvz0","sa3003104"

Heasley moved from the Oklahoma State bullpen to the rotation as a sophomore, but still walked a batter every other inning and gave up more hits than anyone with his quality of stuff should give up in college.
