Even with a raucous 2021 spring performance on his ledger, there are reasonable concerns among pro scouts who saw him about how often he's going to swing and miss. None of this is new. Witt swung and missed a lot during his showcase summer but his subsequent fall and spring were strong enough to make him the second overall pick of the 2019 draft class, and he's the type of talent who'd be a threat to go first in most drafts. 
His skillset compares quite closely to Trevor Story's. There are going to be some strikeouts here because Witt's swing path makes it hard for him to get to pitches down and in, but his combination of defensive fit and game power make him a likely impact player anyway. He's is a big, athletic young guy who moves so well that he makes the field look small when he's running the bases or ranging for a grounder, and he is very likely to not only stay at shortstop but be quite good there. He also has a swing geared for pullside lift (he can bend at the waist to go down and yank balls away from him, too) and the power to hit balls out even when he swings a little flat-footed. He is the son of a former big leaguer and carries himself like one, which has endeared him to scouts and coaches during the course of a high-profile career laden with very high expectations, which Witt has always met and often exceeded. His 2019 pro debut statline lacked power on the surface, but the batted ball data from that year and this spring suggests we shouldn't worry about that. <em>(Alternate site)</em>","t9XYmBesagk","sa3011225"
"Asa Lacy","KCR","SP","A+",24,2,,"55",2022,"High","22.0083333","6' 4""","215","L","L",2020,"Draft","KCR",6670000,"Texas A&M","There are folks in baseball who think Lacy had a strong argument to be the first overall pick in the 2020 draft based on the way his stuff dominated SEC hitters for three years, with their thinking being that Lacy's relief risk was about as scary as Torkelson's need to rake to justify being a 1-1 first baseman. Though he struggled with walks after he moved into the Aggies rotation in 2019, Lacy whiffed 130 hitters in just 88 innings. He was less wild in his brief 2020 four-start jaunt prior to the shutdown, punctuating his pre-draft run with a 13-strikeout game against New Mexico State and fellow top five pick Nick Gonzales. 
Lacy presents scouts with a non-traditional mechanical look that makes his delivery appear pretty violent around his head and shoulders, even though he has less of a head whack now than he did in high school and as an underclassman. While his delivery creates some perceived relief risk (he'd be one hell of a reliever), there is none regarding the pitch mix. Lacy's arm slot creates backspin on the fastball that enables it to have big carry at the top of the zone, his slider has remarkable length for how hard it is, and when Lacy gets on top of his curveball, it has huge, bat-missing depth. The delivery also disorients hitters who take lots of bad, awkward swings at pitches that live in the middle of the zone. His changeup (which Lacy sets up with a two-seamer) occasionally looks good, and might be a real out pitch if it's re-emphasized in pro ball; I thought it was his most polished secondary weapon when I saw him in high school, though I don't have any delusions about it becoming his best weapon now since his breaking stuff is so good. Kansas City seems to have eyes on competing and they've pushed their college draftees lately, so it's possible Lacy will move very quickly. His first minor league spring training outing, in which he was up to 98 and sitting 94 and above, suggests he's ready for such an ascent. His elite stuff and mediocre command give off a Blake Snell vibe. <em>(Alternate site) </em> ","fKeDYi5Wzzo","sa3014423"

On the Cape and during the first half of his junior spring at Virginia, Lynch looked like a solid third round prospect, a pitchability lefty sitting 88-92 mph with mostly average stuff. In the month or so leading up to the 2018 draft, his velo ticked up, and down the stretch he sat 92-94, touching 95 mph deep into starts, with an assortment of offspeed pitches that all flashed above-average. He then sat 93-95 during the summer of 2019 and was often 94-97 during the 2019 Fall League, where he went to pick up innings after missing time with an arm injury. 
Lynch still brings big lefty velo (four- and two-seamers) to the party, as well as a bevy of solid secondary pitches. He throws a spike slider, curveball (really just a release variation on the slider, based on my 2019 high speed footage), and changeup. They're all mostly average, but the slider flashes plus and I think the changeup has room for growth. There are some questions about his fastball's playability but I think the velocity and the repertoire depth here make Lynch a very safe mid-rotation sort who'll likely contribute to the Royals rotation this year. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>","fYTcfoSuY7w","21537"

He was up to 100 last summer and I didn't see a fastball below 96 during any of my spring looks. He's went from a Pac-12 pitchability guy to an upper-90s bully within a couple of months. 
Visibly stronger in the upper body, Marsh attacks the zone with his newfound velocity and mixes in a lot of sliders, which typically sit about 86 mph. His glove-side command of that pitch is very good, and its angle makes it an effective backfoot weapon against lefties. He has some release variation when he throws his curveball but that pitch clearly has utility as a get-me-over strike. While I saw few of them during the spring, Marsh would flash an occasional above-average changeup while he was at ASU, a pitch that has much more effective movement toward the arm-side corner of the plate. Assuming Marsh hasn't lost touch and feel for that changeup via his newfound strength and velo, he's going to have a viable four-pitch mix and be a lock to start. He'll likely move into the top 100 if he can hold the big heat while taking the ball every fifth day during the season. <em>(Constellation Energy League, Alternate site)</em>",,"sa1159950"
"Kyle Isbel","KCR","RF","AAA",,5,,"45",2021,"Med","24.2555555","5' 11""","183","L","R",2018,"Draft","KCR",592300,"UNLV","If you just look at his 2019 statline, it feels like Isbel made some kind of dramatic leap in skill, which in turn facilitated his 2021 debut. But due mostly to injury, you can toss out his 2019 regular season statistical performance. After a red hot first few weeks of the season -- .348/.423/.630 -- he pulled a hamstring, and shortly after he returned to game action in Extended, he broke his hamate and was shelved again until mid-July. As is typical for hitters coming back from that injury, Isbel's numbers were poor -- .216/.282/.361 overall at Wilmington -- and improved the further away from surgery he got, culminating in a strong back half of August and Fall League; his Fall League look especially assuaged concerns. Then he spent 2020 at the alternate site (Kansas City opted out of data/video sharing) before his hot 2021 spring training earned him a spot on the Royals' Opening Day roster.
If there is a more recent reason to alter Isbel's evaluation, it's been his ability to play center field. He got pretty consistent reps there during spring training and looked perfectly fine. I think he'll be supplanted by a superior defensive center fielder (as is currently the case, with Michael A. Taylor getting big league time instead of Isbel) but will be a plus corner defender. That gives him a little more room to play every day since Isbel is more likely to be a solid offensive player than a spectacular one, with the kind of output typical of a corner guy. He's a compact athlete with a compact swing, which helps him impact pitches middle-in and down. His home run damage comes to his pull-side, though Isbel's capable of peppering the opposite field gap with doubles power. He can't really put top-of-the-zone velocity into play but he can get the bat up there to foul it off. He strikes me as a consistent role player, the larger half of a platoon in an outfield corner. He could somewhat outpace that by taking a Josh Reddick trajectory where, because of his defense, he still starts but hits at the bottom of the order against lefties. <em>(Alternate site)</em>","uDxxZ8QvMhY","21614"

He's a lock to stay at shortstop. His timing and actions around the bag as the pivot man on doubles plays are excellent and he has plenty of arm for the left side of the infield. Offensively, Loftin will hit the occasional pull-side tank that makes you think he has big power, but he really only has it to that dead pull side. He'll concede some power in order to poke and serve balls the other way but he's much less likely to do damage that way, and I think he'll be someone opposing teams can pitch to in pro ball and limit damage. 
Loftin went bonkers at a big college tournament in Houston just before the shutdown, and his name was mentioned as high as the middle of the first round, probably for an underslot deal. Late during the first night of the draft, rumors were circulating that a team in the comp round was trying to float Loftin back to them with an overslot deal (I'm not sure if it was KC) and that most teams toward the back of round one had to weigh taking him despite this and daring him not to take slot. He ended up with KC and played at 2020 instructs, then looked really good during 2021 minor league spring training despite playing with a wrap around his hand in several of my looks. He projects as a low-end everyday shortstop. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3014511"

I think he has a chance to be an everyday player but I also think it's very unlikely that he ends up having the sort of meteoric rise some other recent teenage superstar players and prospects have had. When you see Pena in a uniform, you can see where the bonus went and how the hype was born. This is a big, strapping young man built like a Division I safety who stands apart from other kids due to his physicality. That size and strength helps enable Pena to rip the bat through the zone with notable raw power for his age but that hasn't really manifested in consistent in-game production in my scattered looks at him, which date back to 2019 Instructs. 
Pena's swing is noisy and long. There's plenty of time for that to be tweaked if it turns out to be a statistically-evident problem, but in my looks, it has made it so Pena gets jammed pretty often, and makes him late on pitches he shouldn't be. He's strong enough to yank weaker contact through the infield for hits anyway, even if a pitch really ties him up, but aside from the occasional golf shot homer, I think it's going to be tough for him to hit for in-game power with this swing. Now, while I think this problem creates some hit tool risk, there are still huge tools and projection evident in Pena. He's a big, lefty-hitting teenager with a chance to play center and have impact power. Even if problems with his bat persist, he still has plenty of avenues to a lower-ceiling big league role. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em>","fYcFn23SsMI","sa3014686"

His breaking ball quality and his fastball's shape are flaws that push him toward the bullpen. Kowar's mid-90s heater has tailing/sinking action rather than carry and ride, which means it's going to generate groundballs more than it will miss bats. It also means it pairs really well with his changeup's action but not so much with his curveball, which has a noticeable hump that makes it easy to identify it out of his hand. But that pitch has improved a good bit since Kowar has turned pro. His curveball was comfortably below average in college but the Royals have found a way to add raw spin since acquiring him. His spin rate was up from 2150 rpm to 2400 as of 2019, still shy of big league average. Kowar threw some average curveballs this spring but it's not a consistent offering, and only has get-me-over utility even when it's good. I think Kowar's very well-suited to rely on arm strength and his awesome changeup in a bullpen role, and that he'd be a set-up man in the Ryan Madson mold were he to experience a velo bump in single-inning outings. <em>(Alternate site)</em>","6Gnu6dq3LLQ","sa3008273"

He didn't hit during sporadic big league spring training at-bats but has looked fantastic during minor league play this spring, especially on defense. The Royals added Guzmán to the 40-man after his age-20, 2019 season even though he was overmatched at A-ball that year. In the year and a half since then, he has become considerably more physical without really compromising his defensive ability, and he was still making rangy, acrobatic plays this spring. With the strength has come added power, enough that Guzmán is a real threat to do damage when he makes contact. An expansive approach and grooved pair of swings mean he'll likely max out with a 40-grade hit tool, but a plus-gloved infielder with mistake power is still a desirable role-player, and also describes a lot of low-end shortstop regulars. <em>(Alternate site, LIDOM)</em> ",,"sa914314"

Zerpa has good east/west command of three pitches, including a fastball that plays even though it has mediocre velocity. His lower arm angle creates tailing action on his fastball, and his ability to locate it with precision as well as the pitch's late movement make it a viable offering even though it only sits about 91-93. His two-planed curveball and changeup are both above-average and he locates those, too. He doesn't throw all that hard, but Zerpa does have two bat-missing weapons and his command keeps his fastball out of trouble. 
He barely threw with the big league club during the spring even though he's on the 40-man, which I think is a sign that this guy's going to be developed as a starter all year rather than quickly moved to the bullpen, where I think he'd be a fit in a multi-inning role. This is a squat-bodied athlete who can really pitch. Some similar pitchers who I've really liked in the recent past (like Jaime Barria and José Suarez of the Angels) had pretty abrupt body/athletic regressions that detracted from their command and put them in up/down purgatory. There's risk that happens here, but if not then I think Zerpa can become a No. 4/5 starter. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3002993"

Bowlan's velocity has been more stable of late, either because he didn't have a real 2020 workload to deal with or because he's clearly worked really hard on his conditioning and looks to have lost about 25 pounds. He was 94-97 for me this spring, working mostly with a two-seam bowling ball that induces weak groundball contact. His two breaking balls have distinct movement from one another but have tweener movement on their own. There's one pitch with slider/cutter tweener movement and another with slider/curveball shape. There's enough demarcation between the two that I think they'll play, but not as dominant offerings. Bowlan's changeup will be his best chance to miss bats. He has a fifth starter's stuff but I'm 40+'ing him because I think he's going to be an innings-eating force and end up with a little more WAR-based value because of that. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em> ",,"sa3006973"

Instead he signed as an undrafted free agent with Kansas City and is one of several NDFA's from last year who looks like an absolute steal. McMillon's fastball is going to be a monster weapon if he can control it, which was a problem at Texas Tech, where he walked 110 hitters in 145 career innings. When I saw McMillon during 2020 instructs, he was sitting 94-97 with huge carry at the top of the zone. That's up above where he was during his brief, final few innings at Tech, when he was sitting about 92. McMillon's slider has bat-missing vertical shape but its quality really varies, as has McMillon's conviction when he throws it. There's a late-inning reliever here if McMillon can just cinch up his feel for release consistency. The Royals have a really long developmental runway since McMillon just signed. I don't really care that he's already 23, so much as I care (and I think teams care) about his stuff and the fact that he doesn't have to be put on the 40-man for quite a while.

He is going to strike out a ton, too much to be an everyday catcher at the start of his career, but because he has plus power and an unusually good body for a backstop, I think he'll hang around forever and have some seasons toward the back end of his pre-free agency years when he is among the home run leaders at his position. Until then, he's more of a bat-first backup. Melendez had a reputation as an advanced high school defender but things haven't played out that way in pro ball. He's a mediocre receiver and pitch-framer (to my eye, that is; I haven't seen his framing metrics) and he struggles to keep blocked pitches in front of him, with the ball skittering away from him like a hockey goalie who gives up bigger rebounds.

First basemen, even ones with a bevy of secondary skills like Pratto, don't have the luxury of whiffing that often and still becoming big leaguers because the offensive bar at the position is too high. But Pratto has now altered his swing (his stance is open and he has a leg kick now, most notably) and had a huge spring, punishing fastballs at the top of the zone with power. Pratto is geared for this kind of contact now, as he collapses his back side to create lift and just swings as hard as he can at fastballs in this area. He's always had a good feel for the zone and his ability to pick out pitches he can drive is quite good, so I like his chances of continuing to tattoo fastballs at the top of the zone, but I also think Pratto is still really vulnerable to back foot breaking stuff and fastballs running away from him with this swing. I've moved him into the 40+ tier because there's a pretty significant mechanical change that has coincided with a short-term leap in unofficial performance. Maybe Pratto just needs time to gain feel for moving the barrel around the zone with this new swing, but I still think he is more likely to wind up in a platoon first base/power bench bat role. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>","m12VQ7FD72k","sa3004138"

Brentz touched 101 on the stadium gun the first time I saw him (100 on a scout's gun near me) and he never threw a fastball below 95 mph in any of my three looks at him. His feel for locating his slider improved as the spring went on and he now spots it to his glove side pretty consistently.

He really likes to get extended and swing at stuff on the outer half, and Gentry has good vertical plate coverage because when he swings, he adjusts the bend in his lower half the same way lots of the Dodgers hitters do. After a freshman season at Walters State Junior College, Gentry transferred to Alabama and had a pretty solid sophomore year, though his 5-to-1 strikeout/walk ratio was a little scary. He came out of the gates really hot in 2020 and walked as often as he struck out, but that was only a four-week sample.

That includes a 104 wRC+ in a depressed 2019 Southern League, where the average hitter's line was .243/.318/.366.
