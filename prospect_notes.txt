A team's roster is composed of:

- Current players under MLB contract - signed via FA
- Current players under MLB contract - signed via arbitration
- Current players under MLB contract - pre-arb
- Ranked/scouted prospects
- Unranked/un-scouted prospects
- Future prospects from the MLB draft
- Future prospects from the July 2nd signing period
- Future players from the Rule 5 draft

How to sim

Outline of the sim year method:

1. Allocate draft picks and J2 and develop all org prospects by 1 year (prospect model) (graduate prospects to MLB where necessary)
2. Draw and sum WAR contributions from:
	a) Each specific MLB player (player model)
	b) An amorphous "free agent" pot (= total_salary - committed_salary) (free agent model)
3. From WAR, draw season wins
4. Determine playoff seeding, simulate playoffs, and record champion
5. Age players (random aging model)
6. Update team contracts:
	a) Lose players on last year of control / FA deal
	b) Give arbitration contracts based on performance

A prospect development model

2 variables:
- ETA
- MLB potential --> based on FV

ETA - after each year, ETA moves up a year, stays the same, or moves later by a year
